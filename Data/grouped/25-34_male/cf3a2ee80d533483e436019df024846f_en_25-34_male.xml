 Yesterday, a very close friend wrote me a mail. It was strange for it was about, what I actually did in my last 9 months. Word by word, it turned out to be a touching reminiscence. Though I cant share with you the mail, the memories it refreshed are worth sharing. Yes, 9 months is not a coincidence. I worked on a conception. Not unilateral to make it sound mysterious ;) Thankfully, we delivered the baby who is growing well and spreading smiles in 2 interconnected forms. Dear close friend friends-to-be, I will devote time and share with you my sweet-sour experience and days as they pass. Thanks!

As it turned out, we were not to have a fancy whiskey bottle for the next 9 months of our life because on that day, we just became entrepreneurs!! In next couple of weeks, there was no job, no foreseeable cash flows and hardly any savings. However, the idea of supporting and promoting arts seemed to be very inspiring. ]] /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable{mso-style-name:"Table Normal";mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;mso-tstyle-colband-size:0;mso-style-noshow:yes;mso-style-priority:99;mso-style-qformat:yes;mso-style-parent:"";mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;mso-para-margin-top:0cm;mso-para-margin-right:0cm;mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt;mso-para-margin-left:0cm;line-height:115%;mso-pagination:widow-orphan;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} One of the friends got his houses emptied in Jaipur and very soon we had a roof. But the work on business could not begin until we had the basic amenities covered which included buying a fridge, a table, 4 chairs, a gas connection and a white board. These things formed first hard assets of the company and thus far have been our life-line without which we wouldnt sustain a day. This seemed weird at a time when we had just quit our multi-national jobs which enabled us to afford a fancy lifetime. Slowly, we realized that life was about to change...change quite drastically! ]] While the research stayed on internet, everything seemed hunky and dory. We even seemed to make a few nice contacts with NGOs quite fast. It appeared then that we would be able to develop some products and go out in the market by March 2013. As it turned out, in March 2013, we knew 1 artisan in total, no NGO that we knew could produce anything remotely close to what our target clientele wanted. In fact, we did not even know very clearly who our target clients could be. The lesson seemed quite clear..uncertainty is the most important planning input for entrepreneurs and flexibility is a pre-requisite for starting any business, more so, a social business.

It was amazing how nobody would believe our sacrifices let alone our vision, even after we repeatedly tried to convince them that we are working for their welfare. But we were determined and our patience eventually paid. In new couple of weeks, Chuttan became part of Elements family and we had the opportunity of sitting with his friends with Old Monk listening to their love stories. It is fascinating, how all the love stories, from different economic backgrounds share common themes of sacrifice, need to prove oneself and eternal passion. It has truly been a delight knowing Chuttan and all other artisans. It is their stories that motivate us every morning to give our 110% to our business.

With four people working on 1 deal, we were able to impress the client with our gift idea. This was despite the fact that we did not know photoshop or similar softwares to make the product design. A simple MS Paint drawing did it for us. Pumped by the order, we went all in with the production. At that time, production seemed to be a mathematical equation. You put in money and design as the input and the final product will be ready at the committed time. However, for a 1 week committed delivery time, 3 weeks from order, even the first sample for approval was not ready. We had just found out that these artisans who had been making images of deities for years, found it extremely difficult to make Bavarian statue. The client fortunately was a good friend and was not in a hurry and so we could afford this time. Literally, we had to sit with the artisans and motivate them to try and make something new. Half of the times, we would return home frustrated, exhausted and worst of, all empty handed. To see our finished products, please visit www.elementsmart.com ]] We slowly began to understand that offering customization is not a piece of cake and generating new ideas is not actually the newest thing. Like many many experienced individuals say, implementation is the key. We now made a conscious decision to discuss strategies less and get things done. This needed raising some money so artisans could be adequately compensated and motivated for their work. Implementation required being patient but not letting things loose i.e. we stopped getting discouraged with the bad samples and tried to understand the bottlenecks in the process. One such bottleneck was that the artisans were uneducated and through they could design beautiful paintings they could not write English alphabets. We sat with the artisans and created a new artistic form for writing the brand. Small successes like these helped our and the artisans confidence a great deal. A month after the scheduled delivery date we finally completed the order! We got a few thousand rupees for this and spent maybe double of what we received but the lessons learnt in the exercise were priceless. On this day, we finally knew what we had signed for and that not fancy strategies but field work, if we were to reach, could take us towards even moderate success.

First such instance includes our initial meetings with Mrs. Runa Bannerjee of Sewa and Mrs. Komal Srivastava of Hunar. Veterans in the field of social development, especially artisan promotion, they initially doubted if we had the stamina to go the distance. But by the time they heard our story, the appreciation and hope in their eyes was inspiring for us. Outside the core team, they were the first believers in our idea and our vision. Those memories of pride and joy were all that kept us going in some extremely tough times. In hindsight, they feel even better and this is a joy, we believe, only entrepreneurs can relate to. Second was the instance when we delivered our first order to the client we mentioned in our previous blog. The satisfaction in our clients eyes and his appreciation of our efforts felt like a mozarts symphony (well at the team level, we appreciate Mika and Honey Singh more, but this appreciation had an eternal feel to it). I am sure my fellow entrepreneurs would agree with this feeling. Finally, the product reached the German ambassador in India, formed a part of brands expansion in Hong Kong. Slowly but surely, these small steps enabled us to achieve our first Proof of Concept! It is in fact these small successes that make entrepreneurship exciting for us!!

Our sales team recently moved to Delhi to begin business development for corporate gifting. We have also established some foreign partnerships for business development that we are servicing currently but more on that later. For today, Id touch upon a topic all entrepreneurs like us face i.e. managing parents!! Yes, this can be one of the most draining exercises and I dont intend to offer any quick-fix solutions here but just share our experiences. A team of 5, we come from different backgrounds..business, service families and academicians. One constant though is that they all worry a lot and mostly are convinced that we wont go the distance. In the beginning, we make pretences of being the nicest kids around but slowly the business gets on to us and we are back to our normal selves smoking, drinking, listening to Niravana..so on and so forth. And then the faith dwindles down further and the conversations keep getting lesser and more awkward. Not to mention, months of no sales dont help and you are constantly told, we are telling you that this wont work out. Basically, every entrepreneur like us goes through a phase where we are almost convinced that entrepreneurship is the worst choice of our life. Dont get me wrong in any way, as I believe that this worry is perfectly reasonable and at all times, parents are our biggest strengths. In fact, it is a part of their worry that instils that sense of urgency in us..At Elements, we have constantly felt the need to prove to our parents and so far it has gone in our favour. When the small results begin to appear, the pride in their eyes is special. I believe what parents look for is sincerity and perseverance in you..and once they see that, they are relieved and that in itself is a proof that you are headed in the right direction.

Yes, on countless occasions we have spent hours watching motivational videos from Steve Jobs Stanford speech to Al Pacinos inch by inch oration. My personal favourite is the dialogue between Stallone and Ventimiglia in the last film from the Rocky franchise. The question, however, that I ask myself is why has our appetite for such videos increased dramatically since becoming entrepreneurs. It is probably because the real world around appears to have become more thankless. Months of grueling has only enabled us to earn warm appreciation and numerous promises of our esteemed clients. We almost never seem to be on the right time or have THE product. The artisans, who form the basis of our existence, need to feed their families first and promises alone wont do that. Furthermore, feeding ourselves has become a daunting task these days. Our credit worthiness amongst friends has, deservingly, taken a serious nosedive. So we often seek solace in a packet of Maggi and these inspirational videos. I dont know if it provides sufficient proteins, calories and stuff but it makes us feel full! To add to the desperation, every now and then you hear of a friend who is traveling business class, staying in fancy hotels and so on..in these time, you just cant help but think  - I could have been there....You try and not say it out loud but you do think of it. Videos help, but temporarily.. So, how do we move on! Actually, till date, even I cant say with certainty how we continue. I must admit though that being in a team is a blessing and fortunately our low phases dont come together. Also, we seem to have become more thick skinned with experience and can therefore absorb more setbacks. However, the key for me has been the drive from inside, to make it large, not only for ourselves but also for our artisans. In our hearts, we are constantly reminded of the fact that entrepreneurship was never to be a piece of cake. The struggle has just begun and probably it would never end. In fact, the very fun lies in this game of hide and seek that we play with successes and failures on a daily basis. Only when we acknowledge this privilege that has been bestowed upon us, we start feeling alive again. I am hopeful that it is this anxiety in our hearts and dreams in our eyes that will propel us to travel to the end of the tunnel... coz in the end, it aint about how hard you hit, its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward..

A series of unfortunate incidents, some forced choices and other constraints forced us to celebrate this Diwali in 5 different cities. We wonder how Goddess Lakshmi would react to that..but we will continue to keep our faith and bow down in front of her and apologize for any mistakes made, knowingly or unknowingly, and request her to create enough wealth for our stakeholders so that they all can have access to a life we deserve. We had planned a number of interesting messages and new products for this Diwali but as it stands today, our wall is empty. However, we truly wish and pray that all of you had a great Diwali and that the run to the next Diwali be even more amazing for you. Meanwhile, we also request you to stand by us as our Mangalyaan quickly corrects the positions of our stars..:-) Once again, wishing you and your loved ones..galaxy of smiles and joy!! Sincerely, All 5 Elements @ ELEMENTS Please read more about us at www.elementsmart.com ]] So we are back from our space mission and have already been through a number of Team building sessions (aka evenings with lassi and ice creams). To begin our diary again, I am sharing our experience with a positive side effect of being an entrepreneur, visibility. If you have put in good work and are reasonably smart, it is not so difficult to find people who are willing to write/talk about you. These chances are dramatically increased if you have ever been a business school student like me. Whatever be the reason, the feeling when IE Business School decided to write a blog on Elements was quite amazing and at that time, unbelievable. The two blogs published last year show a steady progression of Elements from being a concept in mid last year to a company which started taking shape in due course. We have not been very innovative in reaching out to more media platforms since then but hope to do so very soon. Meanwhile, as we relish these words of appreciation bestowed upon us by IE Business School, I invite you share a bit of our feelings by reading these blogs.
