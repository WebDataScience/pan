This one has a good mix of both love and the sufferings of common people during war. The best part of this story is that the humor has been inserted and right places so that the movie is all that not serious. The love that the lead pair and other pairs share has been well brought out. But at times you feel as though the author has taken a longer route to explain the love, when there was a easier way of saying it.  All the characters in the story play an important and interesting part. The struggle that this little girl had to go through during the 2nd world war that too in the alien land where she totally hated and chased to the very corner of life has been described splendidly so that you really feel pity for her.I always loved the Japanese girls in the Jackie Chan movies i have seen  just because they look like dolls. But the heroine of the story also impressed me a lot with her determination, love and attitude.By reading this book you also get to know some of the Japanese terms ( chance to learn a foreign language ). The climax has also been drafted well showing the after effects of war. It also reminded me of some feel good Indian movies though. Over all it was a pleasant experience reading this book. ]] Sneak Preview of the Book : This is a beautiful scientific fiction thriller.

How does she save herself and her fiancASis forms the rest of this exciting thriller from one of the well known writers. My Review: "Dan Brown what a author he is, chanceless dude".  "Awesome work from Dan Brown". These are some of the words that my friends uttered when they hear the name Dan Brown. This is the first book that i have read written by this author. And yeah i have to agree with my friends for sure. I love edge of the seat thriller movies, so is this story. No wonder his works like DA VINCI CODE and ANGEL and DEMONS have been made into movies. The way that this scientific thriller has been handled speaks volume of this author. The shifting of locations from America to Europe is pcture perfect and does not bore you a single minute. All the characters have been given equal space and equal importance. There are loads of twist in the story and keeps you excited all the time. The manner in which the mystery is finally revealed is also splendid i must say. I felt like i was watching a cool movie when i read this book. A must read for anyone who loves science and thriller. ]] I am sure Archer fans would have loved this book. This happens to the first one of his collections that i have read. ]] You should be cautious about every step that you take. The more you want to move away from something, the more it keeps coming near you. Can your passion and curiosity to explore the hidden truths land you in a big trouble? Everyone around you are in trouble because of you. How to get out of this mess? Just read Double Image by David Morrell. Sneak Preview of the book: Coltrane an award winning photographer whose job is to take photographs of the crimes committed by criminals in war ravaged countries. He escapes near death and some how manages to save his life. He wants to change track and start taking pictures to show beauty and not sorrow as he has been taking so far. But someone wants him dead and follows him like his shadow. Who is the killer? Does the killer succeed in his mission? My Review about the book: The crime thriller has enough stuff in it to keep you interested in reading the book. David Morrell has presented the thriller in a very interesting manner. But i donat know why the author has to combine 2 stories into one? I felt that the book was a master piece for the first half and the second half was just dragging taking us into a totally different plot. I probably think that the author thought that the second half if written as a separate book will not sell as this piece would have sold. Has there been a movie made(adapted) from this book? But i must say Bollywood directors will be itching to take this book to silver screen for sure. I would rate this say 6 out of 10. ]]
