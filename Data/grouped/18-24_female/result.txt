I arrived a bit late, since I thought they would have a big lineup before lighting up the tree. Turns out, they lit up the tree before the performances! Luckily, it was tall enough for me to see from the back. After that, the crowd thinned up and I was able to meet with Joe up front.

Mine was certainly eventful. I spent Christmas Eve with my family (had relatives visiting from London) Andres. We had a wonderful feast of a dinner -- there was everything from shrimp to chicken to pork ribs and popped a bottle of Moscate RosAS. For dessert, I made a lemon raspberry cheesecake (recipe coming soon!) . It was my first time making it, and it was a big hit! I made a second one for Andres' family, where we headed to after our big dinner. Christmas morning, I spent it at Andres' where we enjoyed breakfast while opening presents. Spent the rest of the day relaxing, playing Apples to Apples, and snuggling with our adorable cat Cooper. How was your Christmas Eve/Christmas?

This year, I had the opportunity to try a couple more. Featured here is the Ventu Strainer Bowl . It acts as a strainer and there's a wood covering on the bottom to transform it into a serving bowl. I love that it's two kitchen essentials in one. I also received the Zeus cleaning tool for the winter. The handle is also a snow brush. You can extend the handle and snap it into a shovel or can release the whole handle and use it as a brush. Snapping it back in is pretty easy for storage. It even has reflectors -- you know, in case you dig yourself in a pile of snow. Haha, just kidding! What gadgets would you find useful around the house?

It works with most phones, not just the iPhone. It comes with an extra cable so it acts like a mobile outlet -- pretty handy when you can't find one! I know I have that problem when I'm out, and I have to stop by a Starbucks to recharge - either the outlets are taken or there isn't one around.
