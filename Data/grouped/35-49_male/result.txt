Well, if you have read the chronicle of the press, you will probably be horrified at the description of "inhuman hours', deaths and suicide in the financial sector. Nothing is further from reality. In the City of London more than 450,000 people work in a very competitive, but free environment. Nobody is here by obligation. In fact, the vast majority of those who would like to join this sector never get the chance. We, in our fund, receive more than 50 job requests for each vacancy, and in some cases, such as large funds or investment banks, the figure is over 500 applications per job. Life in the City is tough, and employers demand results, as it should be. Imagine for a second that the person who manages your savings or your pension fund was remunerated by any other measure that was not profitability. Would you invest in this fund?. Work can be strenuous, but slavery-type hours and inhuman conditions are a fiction. Yes, the day begins very early, at six or seven o'clock. But anyone who takes the train at Waterloo Station or the tube at Bank or Liverpool Street knows that at five or six pm the vast majority of people are on their way home. What matters is the achievement of results and targets, and the time and hours used to get there depends on each one's time management. Everyone in the City has had to work long hours and several weekends, but so do entrepreneurs, writers, musicians and journalists. I'm afraid that behind the controversy over the City's death lies more demagoguery than real concern for working too hard. In the same way that no one questions an elite athlete who trains aggressively or a singer that makes 250 concert tours, it is normal for a competitive industry to have people that give their best. Professionals that go through a very thorough selection process and freely take the responsibility, because it is also a passion. This not only work. It is a meritocracy and competition is encouraged. The same thing that many call sacrifice is, for the vast majority in the City, a pleasure. Of course, if someone does not like this environment, he or she is free to resign, and his colleagues will be happy to wish him or her well in another sector. A few miles away across the Channel, France is apparently the model for many advocates of interventionism and government control. France Telecom, now Orange, is a global example of what many would consider a quiet and stable workplace. Semi-state owned, 35 hour weeks, ... a long-term safe environment. So long-term and safe that it is simply impossible to escape from it. In France Telecom, 35 people committed suicide between 2008 and 2009. Nothing is more inhuman than the frustration and despair of living the Kafkaesque nightmare of paperwork, mobbing, and tedious and pointless jobs. But that, of course, does not generate controversy, because that's what many try to sell us as a "good job". When I came to the City of London I was 36 years, I was no kid. Taking the decision was not easy. I went from being a director in a good company in a stable secure, low-risk environment, to a very competitive industry and a salary largely dependent on the achievement of objectives. Everyone around me said it was a mistake, a risky decision. Today, almost ten years later, people say we have been very lucky and it was a good decision. I have a full life, a wonderful family and my work is not a burden because I love it. The day it becomes a burden I will quit, and I'm sure there will be dozens of candidates happy to take my place. Freely. Working in the City is a conscious and free decision. Whoever does not like the system should not worry, because they would probably never be hired. However, between a free and competitive work environment and a safe but frustrating one, there is something that I have very clear: I would not trade freedom for security. Never.]] "The debt compromise is like eating a Satan sandwich" Emanuel Cleaver Yesterday I heard again a sentence that tends to be repeated frequently: "Deficits support growth". It assumes with his claim that increasing deficits helps economic recovery, rather than see that such recovery is much slower and fragile precisely because of the large deficits and the cost of financing them with taxes. The nascent recovery that I have been commenting for a few months has a very clear threat. The over-indulgence of debt accumulation just because cost is low, which leads us to the risk of spending a long time stuck in pedestrian growth levels. The argument in favour of forgetting the debt problem is heard every day.It goes like this: What matters is growth. As long as economies get out of recession, and cost of debt is low, governments should not worry, as little by little indebtedness will be reduced because the denominator, GDP, increases. All is fine. This argument has only three drawbacks: the saturation threshold, destructive debt and volatile cost of debt. . What is the threshold of debt saturation? I have mentioned it several times. The point at which an additional unit of debt does not  generate economic growth, but simply stagnates the economy further. This threshold was surpassed in the OECD, between 2005 and 2007. . What is destructive debt? It's the debt generated by unproductive current expenditure, which produces no positive effect on growth and perpetuates a system that confiscates and engulfs the real economy through taxes, detracting investment and annihilating consumption. In the European Union or the US, a structural deficit of nearly 4% of GDP. . Volatile cost of debt. What makes us think that bond yield and cost of debt are going to stay low forever? We have seen U.S. bond yields rise by 64% so far this year and German soar by 49%. Of course, from a very low level, but the reality is that bond yields can not be kept artificially low forever. And that's when e see debt shocks, because the outstanding debt accumulation increases while low yields are unsustainable. 'Cheap' public debt is not a free pass to spend. In fact 'cheap' is a misnomer, since it assumes that there is no cost of opportunity in private investing or saving. Cheap is dangerous. Think of the perverse situation in a country like Japan, with a debt of over 200% of GDP, where the country's financing needs are over 60% of GDP in 2013. Its ten year bond yields only 0.7%, so the country's incentive to reform is very low... because debt is cheap... Yet if there is an increase in the yield of a 100 basis points it would endanger the entire economy. Japanese public debt, cheap or expensive, is more than 24 times the country's fiscal revenues. On the debt saturation problem, Deutsche Bank recently showed the impact of the last five years: The G7 countries have added almost $18 trillion of debt to a record 140 trillion, with nearly five trillion from central banks' balance sheet expansion, to generate only a trillion dollars of nominal GDP. That is, in the past five years, to generate a single dollar of growth we have "spent" $18 , thirty percent from central banks. All this while maintaining the system's total consolidated debt at 440% of GDP. This 'investment' in growth that is supposed to be accomplished through astronomical deficits, debt and aggressive expansion of central banks simply does not bear fruit. Of course, many say that the solution is to continue doing it until it works. But the system becomes increasingly fragile and subject to massive shocks with the slightest movement of interest rates. These pedestrian growth levels also occur in the middle of a fierce financial repression period . Devaluations and interest rate cuts discourage savings, and push the system further into debt. Money is "cheap" and saving is considered "silly". But meanwhile taxes are raised and disposable income is destroyed. It impoverishes the population in four areas: savings, their profitability, real income and consumption capacity. This leads to a much weaker system, because the fixed costs, public spending, multiplies in cyclical economies, leaving very little room for manoeuvre in hard times . And then governments say it is a revenue problem, as if an administration can be handled waiting for the bubble to return. George Osborne, in the UK, said "a government that spends 720 billion pounds a year cannot be called a government or an administrator, it is unacceptable." Notice he did not say in a moment "it is a revenue problem", which is what we hear in Europe all the time. Revenues come with economic activity, and if we suppress it through taxation to finance an unacceptable expenditure, this economic activity will not improve. Think of Spain, which is showing signs of recovery. Debt to GDP has reached 92%, increasing by 17.16% over the same period of 2012 and above the full year target of 91.2%. However, the Spanish Treasury plans to save about 5 billion euros on cost of financing. Why? The cost of debt has dropped more than financing needs have grown. Phenomenal. The concerns about the European Union is gone, the European Central Bank helps, the economy is slowly coming out of recession ... All true. And the much needed reforms have stopped almost to a halt because debt is cheap. A bad incentive. However, the annual financing needs of the economy are at historic highs, around 70 billion euros. Imagine even if it as 30 billion if Spain reaches its ambitious 2015 goals. Even so, the country relies on an environment of extreme low rates not to suffer a debt shock. But imagine that the low yield party continues, and the Japanisation of European economies deepens. If we, as Japan, absorb the vast majority of our debt, we can achieve the effect of deceiving ourselves and lowering the cost artificially to unacceptable levels under normal conditions (such as the 0.7% of the Japanese ten year bond) Hurray! What will happen? That the perverse incentive to increase spending, not to reform the economy and make debt shoot up to 220% of GDP is too sweet not to be taken by the government. And then the problems become insurmountable, because European economies are not Japan in any sense, from labour to exports or industry. But, imagine that this debt accumulation "does not matter" because we're putting it in our pension plans, in our investment funds and it finances our airports, highways, hospitals, schools. It's the social contract, right? The only contract signed by the unborn to pay the privileges of the living. The problem is that such social contract sweeps away disposable income and savings in financial repression and taxes to finance public expenditure. In The EU it exceeds 40% of gross domestic product. The absolute costs go up because it is always deemed as "little", and the unit costs also soar because the population ages and fewer taxpayers contribute to that imaginary contract. So the economy stagnates. Debt grows. And one day, everything explodes. By then, economists will say that the solution is a devaluation or a debt-haircut, which is to impoverish the entire nation again, destroying the pension funds and savings. In the United States, reverend Emanuel Cleaver called the debt ceiling negotiations the "Satan sandwich" , because among the bread slices there is nothing. The reverend's error was to think that the country can afford eternally a deficit of almost 800 billion, despite stimulus, modest growth and some job creation. Spain's mistake would be to think it's time to relax adjustments because the economy has started to grow. An 0.6% growth of GDP with an increase of 6-7% in debt is simply unsustainable. Now that we see the light at the end of the tunnel it is precisely no time to stop the reforms. It is essential to address the expenses and pay extreme attention to this accumulation of debt, to avoid shocks when yield-seeking euphoria stops, because as we dedicate our efforts to justify every useless expenditure as "small" and debt as "manageable", the system becomes more fragile. And risk accumulation eventually bursts. By then ... governments will blame the markets.]] "Recovery begins from the darkest moment" John Major We have started to see signs of optimism in Europe supported by a macroeconomic environment that, far from being attractive, is showing some encouraging data. But the fragility of the recovery is still high. - Industrial production indices are approaching expansive levels. - Corporate margins are improving, quietly, thanks to exports and cost control. - Private debt has been reduced to 2006 levels. - Financing costs for small and medium enterprises, including Spain and Italy, have fallen to two-year lows. - Gas imports have increased for the first time since 2008, which is very relevant to industrial activity. (Courtesy Morgan Stanley, SocGen) All these elements themselves should not lead us to be overly optimistic, but neither should be ignored. Recovery is extremely weak since, at the same time, countries persist in tax rises and attacks on disposable income that depress consumption. And if we don't see an improvement of consumption, all other variables are simply smoke. Unemployment and consumption are the two great scourges of Europe. With all the government support and a highly interventionist state, unemployment in France has reached three million people. In Spain, above 6 million, it has dropped only by 31 people in August, a moderate slowdown in job losses. But job creation is only going to happen when consumption recovers, and that will not happen in an environment where disposable income is curtailed and taxes destroy families and SMEs. The fiscal burden in the European Union is already about 40%. Threatening to raise taxes on big business now is another huge mistake. They've been a pillar of internationalization and growth, and thanks to them we now have global multinationals, employing tens of thousands. But these strategic moves cost a great effort in debt and weak balance sheets.The cleaning of such balance sheets has not been completed in full, despite cost savings and divestitures, and to raise taxes is a dangerous move that creates more harm than good. Because these large corporations are also big employers, generate the bulk of private investment in the countries, and their social security contributions are one of the main guarantees of the financial sustainability of the welfare systems. Further tax changes would also delay the entry of foreign capital until conditions are stable and attractive. The European Union has warned France that it can not go higher in its tax burden, but this week we read that in 2014 there might be more tax increases. Spain is seeking to raise 25 billion more adding new taxes. Unfortunately, as always, these measures delay the recovery and do not generate the desired revenues. The tax increases are not helping consumer or employment, but also do not improve the borrowing countries. Keep in mind that at the end of 2013 the debt to GDP in the euro area might exceed the current 90.6% by at least 1%, and that the state deficits continues to rise above 4%. In this environment of low interest rates and moderate risk premiums, there seems to be little problem, but low interest rates and strong bond demand do not last forever. Europe, main beneficiary of fear of U.S. debt ceiling From the point of view of the credit market, there is little to worry about, because Europe is likely going to be a beneficiary of the fear that the US exceeds the debt ceiling in October. 16.4 trillion dollars in debt, the fourth time pass this limit since Obama arrived, despite the timid spending cuts and tax increases. A problem that is not going to find a simple solution like the last time, as Republicans will not accept further increases in taxes. But the relative calm in Europe can not mask the huge debt problem across the eurozone, and should be used to prepare a challenging winter. After the German elections, the pressure to accelerate reforms and reduce deficits will increase, no matter who wins. We saw it in the debate between Merkel and Steinbruck. None of them questioned austerity, but the pace of it. In fact, they accused each other of being too complacent with Greece. Thus, European countries, and peripherals in particular are going to have to face excessive deficit budgets, and three risks : - An Italian government crisis amid debt ratios that are much higher than expected.The financing needs of the public sector already reached 60 billion euro as of August 2013, almost double the figure of 2012. - A current account deficit in France of nearly 60 billion in 2013, and a debt to GDP that is on its way to 100% in a short period of time (currently 91.7%). - A deficit in Spain that, despite the recovery, is exceeding all targets. It was 4.38% in the central state, compared with year-end target of 3.8%. So why be optimistic? Since the problem can be short-term financing and that Germany and the paying countries will continue to press for the much needed structural reforms, it is likely that, as I have commented in CNBC a few times, the European Central Bank might conduct another liquidity injection (LTRO) to help the financial system to face the risk of higher interest rates and possible bumps in the huge portfolio of government debt that banks accumulate. Only in Spain, more than 213.6 billion. European banks accumulate up to 20% of Europe's sovereign debt and that weight is monitored constantly by the European Central Bank. But, like other liquidity injections, the problem will be generated if it is used to give another kick to the can and take this slight recovery as an opportunity to increase tax pressure and delay the reform of governments that spend between 10 and 50 billion more than they collect structurally. Because then we will find the same problem as in previous periods of slight improvements: the bureaucratic machine crushes the recovery. Olympics On Friday bets soared giving Madrid some chance to win the 2020 Olympics organization, above the favourite city, Tokyo. For Spain, the possibility of organizing the Olympic Games can be, as always a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the analysis of The Economic Journal ( The Olympic Effect , Andrew Rose and Mark Spiegel) estimates that trade improves 20% over the medium term. On the other hand, it has a cost and means a debt that will probably be very hard to add, even if most of the infrastructure is already built. But if most of it is built there ill be little impact on employment and growth. The Madrid bid is sold as a "low cost" one ith an estimated budget of 1.6 billion euro. Even if that figure is doubled, it's a small percentage of GDP and groth. We'll see. Of the countries that have hosted Olympic Games since 1976, exactly half generated a net profit, and the other half, either lost money or barely broke even. In the UK the cost fell at almost 9 billion pounds and generated a positive impact on the economy of more or less the same amount, about 8 billion, according to the BBC; 8.8 billion according to the Mayor of London. In any case, with or without Olympics, there are reasons to believe in the Spanish recovery, as I said in my article "Spain, Bottoming Out" , and we should not overlook the positive data in Europe, but growth will not return until disposable income improves. And if the tax burden is increased, it is not good news. ]] "However the Germans vote on 22 September, Berlin's attitude to the EU is not going to change much" - Charles Grant Two weeks ago, Angela Merkel and Peer Steinbruck , leading candidates for German Chancellor,  held an election debate on TV. It was a quiet event, without fanfare or big accusations. There were no negative comments to the policies of budget cuts, rather the opposite. Commenting this with German friends, they told me: "The obsession with the so-called austerity is a problem in other countries, here people understand that budgets must be balanced". Merkel ended the debate with a speech that included an interesting sentence: "It's been four good years ". Counting with a public account surplus, expected growth of 1.7% in 2014, and the lowest level of unemployment in decades, 6.8%, she was right. The elections, even with different combinations of coalition, will be, with high probability, a success for Merkel. And that's good. None of the major parties, even assuming a grand coalition, question the spirit of the policies that have been carried out in the past decade. Same as Germany's support to the European project, but there are important elements that have relevant implications for other countries. - The Banking Union: the model that is being sold in the peripheral countries seems like a kind of idyllic solution to a bloated banking system (320% of GDP in Europe) with significant capitalization problems, but in Germany this banking union is rightly considered 'debt monetization through the back door" and cannot be pushed forward while banks have still not carried out the necessary recapitalization processes, including the German ones. - Energy Policy: There has been a great controversy in Germany about the huge increase in electricity tariffs to consumers due to giant solar subsidies. After 100 billion euros in subsidies, final tariffs to consumers have risen by 50% between 2008 and 2013, with the green component (EEG) more than doubling. Merkel is already considering cuts to subsidies and there are strong concerns about the risk of social exclusion for citizens after cutting supply to 60,000 customers who could not pay the exorbitant bills. This can have serious implications on the energy policy of the European Union, directing it towards competitiveness instead of climate change targets. - Bailouts to other countries and deficit targets: a large part of the political debate has focused on the risk of another bailout package to support Greece and Der Spiegel criticized the government for giving figures of the German contribution to help troubled countries that were much lower than the real ones. It is difficult to see the government after the elections being more relaxed about bailouts and missing deficit targets. Germany has accepted huge cuts since the "2010 Plan" implemented by Schroder in 2003 with the goal of restoring competitiveness and economic stability, but Germans perceive that the other countries are not willing to take such measures and the benefits of the German policy is going to the rescued countries, that is why 57% oppose giving more money for bailouts. - European Central Bank : There is no major party that seeks to change the mandate of the central bank, and all seem against the possibility of a further cut in interest rates that could increase the excess of liquidity in the system and the perverse incentives for governments to continue avoiding reforms. The perception that after the elections we will see a relaxation in the German position on Europe is not evident in any of the political manifestos. Because the view in Germany is that there is no firmness, just total acceptance of countries that miss targets. Of course, as the European recovery is confirmed, with an estimated growth of 1.1% in 2014 (Eurozone), and all countries in positive growth territory in that year, even if it is modest, we will see less need for aggressive budget cuts and austerity measures. However, reforms are still needed, especially with countries that spend up to 20% more than they collect. The German model has been much more effective to get out of the crisis than the French proposals to spend its way out of recession. In 2013, France will generate an additional deficit of 4% of GDP, with unemployment topping 10.9%, while Germany generates surplus and lowest unemployment in decades. It's interesting, because Germany and France had similar deficits and debt levels only ten years ago. Germany took the path of reforms and France decided to "stand and wait". The big hurdle is job creation. Germany launched the mini-jobs program and achieved two objectives, switching low-productivity sector jobs into new ones, providing training from a work environment, and secondly reduce unemployment to 6.8%. It was a positive formula to relocate employees out of declining sectors into high productivity ones. Another obstacle to job creation is the excessive tax burden, close to 52%. In these elections Angela Merkel's proposal is to lower taxes after many years of budget adjustments. Germany is nothing without the rest of Europe, and vice versa. It is the second country after France for peripheral exports. This trade should continue to bring Europe out of recession and back into growth. The German commitment to support Europe will stand firm no matter who wins. But it will not be a blank cheque like that of 2008, which led the EU to spend 1.5% of GDP in stimulus to destroy four million and a half jobs. Germany experienced the mistake of those stimulus plans in 2008 and in June 2010 introduced the largest spending cut plan in sixty years, the Zukunftspaket (package of measures for the future) along with a medium-term financial plan (2010-2014), which included cuts to achieve a maximum 0.35% deficit. More than a third of those cuts occurred in the social security and public administration. Despite the crisis, the government deficit fell from 4.3% in 2010 to a surplus of 0.2% in 2012. And having met the objectives of 2014 more than two years early, finance minister Bertrand Benoit announced new cuts of 6.1 billion euros in July this year. The policy of keeping reforms is absolutely essential for a strong Europe, to avoid a collection of oversized governments in indebted and inefficient countries. The German elections, if Merkel wins, will provide continuity for the rest of Europe. And that's good. The recovery process cannot be achieved by adding debt and deficits all over. It has to be made surpassing individual goals ... This is how the European Union strengthens. The policy of fiscal prudence, wrongly called austerity, must continue. ]] Richard Fuld (ex-Lehman CEO) "The blame on the firm's share price collapse lies on hedge funds and short sellers" On September 15th 2008... ...

Zig Ziglar I have mentioned in interviews for a few months that indicators show that Spain is bottoming out and showing signs of improvement. Nobody can deny that in the past I have always doubted the so-called "green shoots", but this year the encouraging data accumulation is significant. It is worth noting two things: . Positive data begins to seem plausible for the investment community , wary of the eternal "we are improving" messages of our country that end up being mirages.The UBS report "Spain is getting better" is a relevant example. . We must avoid the risk of complacency. The fragility of the economy remains huge and, as we saw in the past, slowing don the pace of reforms and maintaining structural inefficiencies can lead the country to a standstill. Hitting the bottom and staying there is the biggest risk that I've been mentioning for months. The "Japanisation" of Spain and another lost decade. Unemployment data and expected GDP are two elements. Spain might leave recession this quarter with an 0.2% growth. That unemployment fell down to 26.26%, 225,000 less, is a positive. Even if we take the data with all the caution in the world and knowing that unemployment is still unacceptably high, it shows that the trend of stopping job destruction, which timidly began to show in April, is now evident. But there are other data that seem very relevant. The Purchasing Managers Index was 50 in June, which is the level at which the economy begins to approach the possibility of expansion. Bank deposits have also increased after years of decline, rising 0.46% to 1.48 billion euros in June. But the most important data-point for me is the strength of exports, both in volume and margin for companies, showing how a country can improve dramatically without falling into the easy trap of devaluation. Minister Luis de Guindos this week highlighted the importance of the long-term internal adjustment conducted by Spain. It is very important because, unlike the devaluation of the currency, it does not create a disproportionate increase in imports and inflation. A more durable and long-term positive effect. Spanish exports have reached a record high absolute and relative to Europe, but our current account balance has not deteriorated, in fact, it has improved massively to be in surplus. This improvement is not only due to the much needed decline in internal demand. Spain does not need more wasteful infrastructure spending. The improvement in exports and margins show a combination of entrepreneurial effort and commitment to value. Another important factor to note is that corporate debt has fallen to 2006 levels and that, following general declines in recent years, the country has started to see large multinational companies post better figures in Spain (IBM, L'Oreal, Carrefour). Where should we focus attention to trust this timid recovery? Consumption continues to fall. It is essential that the government understands that disposable income should improve, not through forced wage increases, which would lead to cost inflation, lack of competitiveness, unemployment and prolonging the recession, but cutting taxes. It is the only way to improve consumption and revive the economy. BBVA's report "Consumption Outlook First Half 2013" clearly shows that importance. Excessive debt and deficit. The fact that there is no pressure to reduce the deficit below 6.5% in 2013 and 5.8% in 2014 does not remove the risk that such amount of new debt creates, more than 130 billion euro. It involves an enormous drag on an economy here debt already exceeds 90% of GDP. Because the current environment of low interest rates, investor appetite and moderate risk premiums may change in a global economy. Administration reform and adjustments . The government emphasizes that the structural adjustment was 4 percentage points of GDP and 300,000 public jobs have been cut, but spending on public wages has not dropped significantly and the weight of public expenditure is still extremely high (almost 50% of GDP including public enterprises). Relaxing the reforms has an immediate negative effect on an economy as fragile as the Spanish. New issuance of debt ( 136 billion) and net requirements ( 76 billion) continues to be at record highs, almost four times higher than the 2005-2007 average. If Spain's rating is lowered, the castle could crumble. Non performing loans will continue to rise, probably to 13% due to the recognition process of refinanced loans, which continue to hinder the credit market, but the Spanish banking sector is no longer a danger of being a black box where no one knows what is hidden. It has carried out a process of transparency and capitalization unlike any other European countries. The energy reform has raised concerns among investors about the risk that the cuts are extended and perception of legal insecurity. The fact that Minister Soria has discussed with investors, and openly acknowledged the issues of cost and overcapacity in Spain is an important initiative that should be repeated often for the government to understand the concerns, opportunities, risks and consequences of its actions. Spain has made ??progress, but is far from healed, and has lost 10 positions in the ranking of countries with more economic freedom according to the Heritage Foundation primarily due to the tax increases. Now it needs further reform, lowering taxes and liberalization to recover those ten positions and as many more. In the market I perceive genuine interest to see Spain prove to be the first major success of the so-called "austerity" in Europe, which is not austerity but fiscal prudence. Spain is proof that the best solution to correct the excesses of massive infrastructure spend and real estate bubble is internal adjustment. Germany proved it with its "Agenda 2010" launched in 2003, which has helped unemployment fall down from 11 to 7.2%, get the social security system in surplus and the public accounts from a 4,8% deficit to an impressive 0.2% surplus. I sincerely hope Spain does not relax its commitments thinking it has done enough, and shows what everyone says in London. When Spain does well, it rocks. ]] You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.

William J H Boetcker's Ten Cannots]] Our country is headed toward a 'fiscal cliff.' The bad news: We elected a guy whose campaign slogan was 'Forward' - Jay Leno See my intervention on CNBC about the matter here: http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?play=1video=3000205718 and http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?play=1video=3000205434 and on the BBC here One of the perverse government incentives that we have always discussed in this column is the policy of kicking the can forward. Governments relax the objectives of debt and deficits, introduce monetary expansion measures, cut interest rates and what happens?.  They exceed all limits and debt grows faster. As a magic formula to resolve a balance sheet crisis it is simply not working. Government spends more, debt continues to soar and the citizen gets buried in taxes. Thank you for your money. Look at the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States. Financial repression has only encouraged more excessive borrowing. The mantra that is repeated again and again, "now is not the time", "we have to borrow more", "the important thing is to grow" simply does not work. It is not a matter of growth. As we commented two weeks ago, in the past five years, the G-7 'spent' $ 18 to generate $1 of GDP. As I expected throughout the negotiations of the fiscal cliff in late 2012, it was only a matter of time until the US exceeded the debt ceiling . Indeed, this might happen in October. The situation is so perverse that the government spending machine accelerated ahead of the deadline like the car in the final scene of Thelma and Louise. In less than four months in 2013, the Obama administration has added 300 billion debt to the system. That, after raising taxes and introducing budget cuts. And now, as the deadline approaches, President Obama has the audacity to declare that the government "will not allow to be blackmailed" . It is a superb tactic. First, full throttle spending, exceed all limits, despite the economy growing and tax revenues helping, and then ask for more spending. Like a child that says "if I don't get more sweets I will stop breathing". Amazingly, in 2006 Obama, then senator, voted against raising the debt ceiling. Seven trillion dollars of debt afterwards, he seems to see no problem in lifting it . It's worth watching this video from his 2008 campaign and what he said about raising the debt ceiling: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydZTHPkOnvE Since 2001, the debt ceiling in the United States has been 'raised' 13 times, which has led to an accumulation of additional debt of 10.4 trillion. The main mistakes we usually read about the US debt ceiling are: - The US is not going to default because they can print all the money they want. However, in 1979 it had to delay payments on debt maturities for 122 million, and the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011 culminated on August 5th with the loss of the country's debt top rating of 'AAA' by Standard Poor's. Of course, monetary expansion (Quantitative Easing , QE) keeps the appearance of normality, but to quote Richard Koo in his report "U.S. faces QE "trap", "the vicious circle of rising interest rates and economic weakness has already begun". "No country has injected so much liquidity and lived to tell". The 'magic bullet' trap of expanding the monetary base is simply impossible to stop without negative consequences, because the debt has soared and the economy does not improve. - Everything is just political posturing , the debt ceiling will be raised and all will continue normally. Since 1976 there have been seventeen shut-downs where the federal government can not carry out new spending. In 1995-96 the shut-down in the administration Clinton lasted 21 days. The Obama administration reached the debt ceiling in May 2013 following an unprecedented increase in spending from February to July. Give a cheque to the government and it will spends it, and more. In this occasion it has managed to keep within the 'limit' with "extraordinary measures", but on October 17th the limit simply is unavoidable. This time it will not be easy for Republicans to accept another deal that will probably lead to another fiscal cliff in May-June 2014. - It is an unjustified attack from Republicans. The Obama administration wants to spend $1.1 trillion in "discretionary" spending in 2014. Discretionary. The maximum allowed currently is just ten percent lower. Therefore, it is not a monstrous disaster that leaves families in the streets and the state without resources. It is simply a matter of budgetary restraint and to delay a social security plan, Obamacare , that is generating more doubt and concerns about the cost of its implementation than the existing Medicare system. - The cost of a 'government shut-down' is irrelevant. The 1995-1996 one is estimated at about 2 billion dollars of today. In 2014 it could mean 35 billion. The debt ceiling problem in the United States will not be the same now that interest rates are rising, the Fed has had to revise down their growth estimate for the economy and the risk of a new fiscal cliff in a few months looms again. Even if yields are low and demand is strong, a deficit of close to 800 billion and a debt of 101% of GDP do not improve with the economy growing just 2 to 2.2%. The U.S. must tackle immediately its spending spiral . All debt ceiling increases in the past have been accompanied by more and more deficit spending. Kicking the can forward has worked as interest rates fell. Now, the risk of ignoring the accumulation of debt and keep spending is too high, as is the case in the UK or Japan, the other kings of the money printing press.  Because there is only one way for interest rates to go. Up. The perverse incentive of "debt does not matter", matters in the end. A lot.]] "The most scary thing is that even the Central government does not really know how large the size of the local government debt is". - Hu Yifan I mention it constantly. Massive debt accumulation generates greater fragility in the financial system. While global PMIs maintain their expansionary phase, we start to feel a certain level of deceleration. Fitch reduced its global growth estimates for both 2013-to +2.3% - and 2014-from +3.1% to +2.9% -, and the more cyclical companies that have posted results are cautious about the outlook for 2014. We should note that some economies are moving dangerously towards stagnation. Brazil , damaged by the populist policies of Rousseff , with soaring inflation, is poised to post virtually no growth in 2015 and India, with a growing current account deficit and high inflation in food prices, is a concern that I have mentioned before in this column. However, in between investor euphoria, the liquidity trap of monetary stimulus created by the eternal QE and imbalances in emerging countries, we had forgotten China. It is worth analysing some data. China continues to grow in a planned and optically spectacular way (9.1% annualized in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2012). The machine is doing 'okay' as long as the Government keeps it well oiled. It is the triumph of massive debt and central planning. Triumph? No, it is not . Even prime minister Li Keqiang, according to Reuters, referred to Chinese GDP as "man-made and for reference only ". A model of high debt and central planning that Spain implemented with disastrous results in the decade of "debt does not matter". The Shibor (the Chinese interbank rate, similar to LIBOR) soared again last week, as it did in June. The interest rates in an excessively leveraged economy move back up again, despite past interventions of the People's Bank of China, putting at risk an economic system where the amount of non-performing loans and the true amount of provinces' debt are unknown. - Indeed, the Chinese provincial debt is not really known . Analysts' estimates move between $2.5 trillion and $5 trillion, between 30% and 60% of GDP. In the United States, for instance, it's less than 18%. This lack of transparency and information also shows how little control the central government has over the regions' debt . Maybe that's why it has approved the creation of regional bad banks, to try to reduce systemic risk. - The private credit bubble, according to Credit Suisse , is above 178% of GDP, 26% above the acceptable maximum. Total debt reached 200% of GDP. Remember Spain in 2007? It was close to 300%. And the level of spending-investment- is 12% higher than Japan at the height of its stimulus policy. Investment to GDP exceeds 48%, almost 10% more than the countries that industrialized more rapidly in the twentieth century. Of course, many people justify this level of investment by the need to modernize the country. However, in infrastructure, China suffers from overecapacity in many areas. It has the same highway density as the UK or the U.S.. - All this credit bubble would not be a problem if Chinese companies were making fabulous profits and margins were spectacular, which would make the debt easily payable. However, 48% of the Hang Seng Index (comprising the largest Chinese companies) generated returns below cost of capital in 2012 and almost 30% did not cover financial costs with free cash flow. Does that sound familiar to those who heard "debt does not matter because most is non-recourse" in peripheral Europe in 2007?. Net margins of Chinese companies are the lowest (2.5%) of all emerging countries (average 6%). - A real estate bubble uncomfortably similar to the Irish or Spanish. Real estate investment is 18.7% of GDP compared with Spain at the height of our bubble (22%) and Ireland (20%). The ghost towns that populate the Chinese geography are well known, but when growth has started to slow down, new housing construction has soared by again to keep the "growth by central mandate" plan, surpassing sales by 20%. - Aggressive borrowing process. Today China takes up to four times more debt than in 2010 to create one unit of GDP. So what's the problem? The arguments supporting or justifying the Chinese Model are: "You're a scaremonger, this has been the case since 2000." "While there is credit available and the government decides it, China will grow as much as needed, there is no problem." "As long as the non-performing loan risk is concentrated in its banks, there is no contagion to the rest of the world." "There is no bubble, only a moderation of growth." "As long as China grows above 5%, the rest of the world is fine." Surprise, it's the same we heard in 2007-2008 in Ireland or Spain. However, China has huge implications for global credit markets -as it's the second-largest buyer of U.S. treasury bonds-, and for the anaemic industrial recovery process on which Japan depends heavily to improve its exports. These data, as Goldman Sachs ,UBS and Credit Suisse point out in its excellent report "China: Curb Your Enthusiasm", show an uncomfortable reality. The Chinese government is faced with two alternatives: to grow artificially leading to a financial crisis of unpredictable effects, or clean its banks of systemic risk, which unquestionably means to limit credit expansion, and thus stopping its growth-through-debt model. Non-performing loans in China now exceed $88 billion. A figure that seems surprisingly low, as it is "officially" only 1% of total loans, compared with 9% in peripheral Europe or 12% in Spain, but the ratio is disguised by the huge amount of new loans, and the methodology to account as non-performing. But everyone, including the central government recognizes that the magnitude of the problem is worrying . An entrepreneur friend of mine, when asked if he was considering expanding to China said, "China is like the lottery, you can win, but most pay more than they receive." How long can the China bubble last? Years, or months. But today it's not a matter of 'scaremongering' or unwarranted concerns. The combination of low margins, massive debt and economic multipliers plummeting alarmingly always ends up badly. How badly it will end depends on the decision of the Chinese government. Moderate the madness or head towards a financial crisis. ]] Oil is flat and looking at a weak short term trend sliding between $105-110/bbl Brent. The short term palliative of a deal in Washington to temporarily address the debt ceiling and budget overcame the potential longer-term implications of reports of constructive dialogue between Iran and the global powers in Geneva which has the potential, given the US' positive reaction, to see sanctions eased. Clearly there is a long way to go to get to something substantive and Iranian exports will not recover quickly but fall in Iranian's exports has compensated for poor demand growth and strong US production growth. I still see the discount of WTI to Brent ($10/bbl currently) widening as supply in the US and inventories increase while tightness in Brent market remains, with Libya disruptions continuing. Libya's oil production is stable at around 600kbpd, where it has been for about a month. The Eagle Ford shale of South Texas has nosed ahead of the rival Bakken play of North Dakota in the race to produce 1 million barrels per day of oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The EIA's new monthly Drilling Productivity Report says total production from the Eagle Ford hit the 1 million-bpd milestone in August and expects output to rise to 1.07 million bpd in October, and to 1.09 million bpd in November, Reuters reported. Regarding US production of shale oil and gas, an EIA study was published that covers the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Niobrara, Permian, Marcellus and Haynesville tight oil/shale plays which it says covers over 90% of US tight oil/shale production and nearly all gas production (~3.7m b/d of oil and ~34,000 mcf/d). States new well production per rig (b/d) has increased yoy in all 6 regions for both oil and gas, with the exception of gas production in the Niobrara which is down and in the Permian which is flat. Most notable were the increases yoy in Bakken oil and Marcellus gas production/rig.  Conversely production from older wells is falling faster than it did a year ago for oil, though little change in the trends for gas, on average. Net net, the EIA estimates that oil production in November will rise (vs Oct) in all 6 regions, by ~60k b/d (+1.6%), primarily from the Bakken and Eagle Ford. The picture for gas is more mixed with the IEA predicting rises from the Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Bakken but falls from the Haynesville and Niobrara (Permian flat), leading to an overall rise of just over 1% m/m. US crude inventories have been building on strong domestic supply and the onset of refinery maintenance season.. This week EIA Crude stocks were +5.25 mboe vs. +4 mboe expected. Gasoline stocks -1.81 mboe vs. -2.57 mboe expected. Demand 18.269 Mboepd, yoy -4.5% . Crude oil production up +1,286 kboepd yoy. Reuters is suggesting Kashagan may not resume operations this month (ENI 17%, XOM 17%, RDS 17%, TOTAL 17%, KazMunaiGas 17%, COP 8%, INPEX 8%). 76kboped less supply. US Ga s also likely to keep the $3.80-4/mmbtu level. Inventories are now 3,577bcf, widening the surplus versus the 5-yr average to 57bcf. Since May, weather has been 1% cooler than the 5-yr average. Over the last month, the weather-adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been 0.7bcf/d oversupplied vs the 5-yr average. US natural gas producer hedging activity has slowed in the past quarter, but with $4/mmbtu, a greater portion of next years gas output is hedged than in the past three years. CO2 is in no man's land and likely to be rangebound for a while despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel support for EU plans to prop up carbon prices by temporarily removing some of the surplus allowances. "We need a degree of back-loading of CO2 emissions so that the certificate price can reach a reasonable level again," Merkel said. She said a rise in certificate prices would help modern, flexible gas-fired power stations which were now struggling to compete with coal-fired plants, which emit many more carbon emissions, because carbon permit prices were now so low. Coal has enjoyed a short term rally driven by stronger thermal coal demand in Japan (+24% ytd) but oversupply, high inventories and weakening India and China consumption are likely to keep it rangebound. Latest port data shows that India imported 9.1mt of thermal coal in September the lowest since last year. This is an 11.6% mom decline and 33.5% down YTD. Met coal imports rose 8% to 25.1mt. The outlook short term remains poor and traders comment that the rupee's weakness curbs Indian buying and an open arbitrage remains the key to China's appetite for seaborne coal, meaning neither is likely to bid thermal prices higher On the positive side, Japanese thermal coal demand remains strong +24% YTD as nuclear output still not improving. Despite Japanese data, inventories and oversupply still weigh in on price. Australian coal exports continue at a strong pace. At just under 8.2mt, they are up from the 7.6mt YTD average, with both met and thermal coal shipments up WoW.  The World Steel Association released global steel and pig iron production data for September earlier this week. Global production reached an annualised rate of 1,613mtpa, up 7% YoY, but the real story was the return to growth of ex-China steel production for the first time since May 2012. Morgan Stanley mentioning safety regulation in China could put a floor on coal despite oversupply. Both Central and Shanxi local governments issued new policy papers on enhancing mine safety standards. a) State Council aims to shut down at least 2,000 mines by the end of 2015, targeting coal mines of  less than 90 thousand mt b) The government will stop approvals for new coal mines with annual capacity of less than 300 thousand mt c) Shanxi government is ordering a halt to all new mine construction projects and plans to conduct safety checks. The halt came after a mine accident at Shanxi Coking Group on Sept 28. MS estimate this will reduce Shanxis new capacity additions by 40-80mt from the initial expectation of 100mt for this year. UK Gas looks to remain strong and trading above the resistance of 69p/therm as volumes from Norway pick up. No unplanned LNG cargoes diverted to UK this week as demand from Asia continues to absorb most supply of LNG. . Inventories fall further below the 5 year average but companies maintain there is still enough to supply the winter demand. With storage levels in the UK trending near five-year lows (4,539 mcm), the likelihood of a spike is quite relevant as we enter maintenance season in Norway. Power prices in Europe will probably remain weak, with German power down as thermal output continues to disappoint with wind and solar taking up to 39% of all generation and capacity cuts mentioned by RWE more a long-term fix than a reality that could help prices. German power demand in August declined -1.9% y/y on working day adjusted basis (-2.6% unadjusted) according to BDEW data, despite August industrial production being up 0.3% y/y. Demand is also down for the first 8 months 2013, by -1.2% y/y. Brokers mentioning the possibility of stabilizing the German power market through capacity closures. The industry has so far announced 7 GW or 5% of thermal capacity closures over the next 5 years. UBS estimate that this would need to increase 7x to 50 GW to stabilise profits at the 2012 level. Nordpool is sliding back to parity with German power prices, with demand weaker, weather improving and hydro generation picking up, its likely to continue to slide unless winter kicks in colder than expected. ]] Remember Lou Reed.

I have been talking all month about the widening driven by tightness in Brent and ample supplies in US. Brent has stayed strong this week on the drying up of Libyan exports. No such supply issues in the US where crude stocks have risen well above the 5-yr range causing the Brent-WTI spread to widen abruptly. EIA this week: Crude stocks +4.09 mboe vs. +2 mboe expected. Gasoline stocks -1.71 mboe vs. +0.03 mboe expected. Demand 20.14 Mboepd, year-on-year +9.9% . US Crude oil production up +1,184 kboepd year-on-year. Peak what?. Coal slump continues, now at $82.00/mt, losing all its October gains as ample increase of exports from Australia and South Africa meet high inventory levels all over Europe and milder weather. We would not see switch from gas to coal at a meaningful level until coal reaches $81/mt according to Morgan Stanley. US gas continues to slide at $3.64/mmbtu. Weekly storage rose 38bcf, well below the 5-yr average of a 57bcf injection. Inventories are now 3,779 Bcf, narrowing the surplus versus the 5-yr average to 57bcf. Last weeks weather was 34% cooler than the 5-year average. Over the last month, the weather-adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been 0.4bcf/d oversupplied versus the 5-yr average. A drop below $3.50/mmbtu would prompt increased consumption in the power generation sector. Gas-fired generation becomes increasingly competitive with coal-fired power plants as gas prices drop, and as much as 1.5-2 Bcf/d of natural gas consumption can be lost and gained in the power generation sector as prices swing in the $3.25 to $4.25 /mmbtu range (according to UBS). UK gas is the only rock star commodity... Back at 69.70p/therm, above the resistance level of 69.50/th seen all month. Daily demand increased to 193 mcm from average month daily demand figure of 175 mcm. Despite acceptable storage levels, 4,600 mcm, prices have shot with demand increase. CO2 continues to collapse at 4.63/mt despite on-going talks and meetings expected in November at EU level to discuss strict measures to curb EUA oversupply. The debate in Brussels has already moved on from backloading to structural reform proposals, which could eventually lead to tightened system. Commission officials are increasingly sold on the idea of a flexible reserve mechanism, aimed at making the ETS a more responsive system so that a large over or under supply could not build up in future. Officials seem convinced that such reform should take effect in Phase III (2013-2020) though nothing will likely be agreed before 2015 and how this could work in practice is unclear. Don't bet on the EU to make a big change, and CO2 price reflects it. Power prices in Germany fall (again) to 37.35/MWh and Nordpool to 38/MWh. No real bullish argument either from weather or industrial demand anywhere in Europe except the UK where reserve margins remain tight (clean dark spreads at 26.5/MWh vs 24/MWh in September). In Southern Europe, demand continues to be weak. Power demand in Spain in October was down another 1.2% weather adjusted, with gas demand down 10.6%.]] Relying on ever-rising house prices pushing home values up via artificially cheap lending creates only the illusion of growth - Ros Altmann As you know, I have lived in London for ten years. The United Kingdom, throughout the Gordon Brown years, was the Keynesian stimulus experiment that the advocates inflation and devaluation always 'forget'. They talk a lot about Abenomics and Obama but forget the stimulus+inflation-led economic destruction of the early 2000s, and the hole in public finances it caused. A hole that the UK has not been able to dig itself out of, despite carrying out a brutal monetary stimulus policy where the Bank of England buys nearly 70% of the public debt issued. However, to the surprise of many experts, the United Kingdom appears to be starting to recover quickly. It is estimated that the economy grew by 1.5% in the first nine months, with a marked acceleration from quarter to quarter, to 3.2% annualized, and that will continue to advance by 3% in 2014. Given that in 2012 the economy grew by only 0.2%, the results are spectacular to say the least, especially considering that other members of the 'Money Printing Club' - Japan and the United States - continue to disappoint with very questionable macroeconomic results, from a massive trade deficit and debt in Japan, to lacklustre growth and weak labour market, according to the Federal Reserve itself, in the U.S.. What is the miracle of the British economy? Probably a housing bubble of dangerous proportions, already warned by newspapers as ideologically diverse as the Daily Telegraph , The Guardian and City Am (" Subprime Britain", read an article). There are unquestionable positive elements: - The UK now exports more outside the European Union (52%) than inside, being less exposed to the crisis in the Eurozone. Having reached a record high in June 2013, and growing at 3% annually, exports are about 32% of GDP. - Car sales have soared and have almost returned to pre-crisis levels, while in the European Union these remain at depressed levels. The exchange rate pound-euro favours European car sales in the UK. - After the recent tax cuts and support for small and medium enterprises, the level of unemployment reached its lowest levels since 2009, 7.7%, despite increased immigration. In addition, consumption began to grow, with data from Coffer Peach showing sales increases in restaurants (+1.9% in August) and hotels (+4% in the first half of the year). - Government deficit starts to decrease significantly. Cutting taxes, attracting capital and laying the red carpet for entrepreneurs works. And has generated record tax revenues ("tax receipts hit record high of 1bn per week more than Labour grabbed" read the Daily Telegraph). 25 billion pounds more in revenues, according to HMRC. See below the graph of the UK government deficit (-10% to -5.8%). - However, all this data is positive but not comparable to the impact of the Help to Buy policy, also known in the UK as the 'Viagra of the housing bubble'. The effects were very fast. Home prices have surpassed the 2008 peak, and they had already risen significantly with the entry of foreign money coming out of the EU looking for a safehaven against the risk of the euro break-up. This saw up to 80% of the houses sold in some areas going to Greek, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian investors in 2011-2012, according Foxton's. Companies like Grafton, a construction material supplier, have seen their sales in the UK rise by 5.5%. Cemex commented that sales in the country grew by 9% in the second quarter. The demand for housing, according to Crest Nicholson, was up 46% since the implementation of the Help To Buy.... And the average salary of construction workers rose 20% in the first half of 2013. See the index of house prices from Nationwide: Is this all positive? Demand grows, the economy grows, house prices recover, people see 'perceived wealth' increase, more furniture and curtains are sold... But there are several warning signs: - The guarantee of cheap money from the Government increases the risk of bad payments. There have been 210 billion pounds in aid available in the Funding for Lending and Help To Buy programs, while the ratio of debt to income soared for first-time buyers from 3 to 1 to 4.4 to 1 (The Daily Telegraph). - Most home sales -over 50% - are made ??without mortgage and sold to foreign investors looking to rent. But there is a lot of leverage hidden in these "yield-seeking" operations. Sometimes up to 75%. Maybe not mortgages, but loads of corporate debt. And in some cases, rental yields are as low as 2-3% (in Central London, for example). At the same time, rents have increased much faster than wages for five consecutive years, leading to an increased risk of default or exclusion, where, even if there is housing availability, conditions for rental are simply unaffordable. - In London the housing bubble seems well supported by two factors: the City and the arrival of foreign millionaires of any country. As a friend of a real estate agency says, "there is always a country that is doing well, and those people go to London as a first option." This is why London has become the most expensive city in the world, surpassing Tokyo. But that 'bubble expansive wave' is dissipated as one moves out of the M-25 (the ring road around London), which creates the risk of 'bubble implosion' as we saw in 2008. Prices soar starting in London and the shock waves reach up North, and when the bubble implodes, it impacts down to the South. Of course, the Bank of England is "carefully monitoring the risk of the creation of a possible bubble." It does not see danger today because transactions and mortgages signed are well below the highs of 2008, and because a large part is sold without any type of mortgage (but a lot of corporate debt). But that is where the risk lies... When those funds that buy real estate thinking of high rental yields find that there is an excess of unsold homes, which is never recognized as you all remember, corporate debt defaults start to rise. At the same time, the possibility of selling those houses becomes difficult because wages don't increase and the capacity of the majority of population to acquire just gets worse ... That is when the market sees the hidden stock of homes. The argument that the UK needs to build even more houses to cope with demand and help lower prices doesn't stack up. Building is a pro-cyclical business. And demand cannot rise eternally with wages and disposable income falling or stale. Perhaps this time the house price rise is more sustainable growth, as some argue, as it is less aggressive in debt. I would be cautious. This time we are substituting mortgage risk for corporate debt risk. Economic growth supported by a disproportionate increase in the price of houses and thinking that these can only go higher because "we need to build much more to meet future demand," explodes aggressively on almost all occasions. This time, moreover, the risk is in the balance sheet of the government that guarantees the Help To Buy, and therefore, if it goes wrong, you will pay it in tax hikes. We have to keep an eye on this risk. But above all, a message to countries that do not attract hedge fund managers, Russian millionaires or Rock stars: Please do not copy the formula. ]] Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something Necessary and imperative - Nassim Taleb I do not understand Bitcoin, but I do not understand women either and I am married - U.S. trader During the intense weeks promoting my book Journey to Economic Freedom I've been asked several times about my opinion on Bitcoin , the so-called "virtual currency" that has increased in price more than 100 times in eleven months. My opinion is simple. Bitcoin is not a reality, it's an expectation , and therefore its price evolution depends on it getting deployed globally and clarifying doubts about its role as a method of payment and 'storage of value'. Bitcoin is a startup currency. Its initial appeal is undeniable. A method of payment where states can not interfere in the money supply, and where investors can find a safe haven from the assault on the saver that is the increased financial repression imposed by governments and central banks. Sure, but my doubts come when the haven is virtual , and therefore always subject to hacker attacks. In addition, there's the risk of a confiscatory reaction from states if it reaches a 'dangerously high "implementation. 'Free' currencies tend to end up being abolished or confiscated. For now, Bitcoin is not a currency, it is an exchange network. Like a financial asset, a future or a derivative. Unlike legal tender currencies, no one is forced to accept it as a method of payment. It is not dissimilar to a barter coupon. You accept it as payment for goods and services just the same way as you use something  that is perceived as valuable by both parties, buyer and seller, be it a watch, a car or Bitcoin. As such, its value ??comes from the generalized perception of scarcity, future demand, liquidity and quality as a means to exchanging it for another currency, goods or services in the future. As a 'storage of value' asset it has some similarities with a gold ETF , but it is massively more volatile... and virtual. Therefore it is subject to extreme changes of perception with a supply and potential demand that is difficult to estimate. However, it has no real similarity with physical gold , having no history of transactions in times of extreme crisis. Everyone knows that gold can be exchanged for goods and services in case of a global catastrophe. Nobody knows yet how you create virtual storage of value. To be a currency, Bitcoin must go a long way in implementation, and be accepted globally for large and meaningful commercial transactions. Is Bitcoin a speculative bubble? A pyramid scheme, a Ponzi scheme? I finally received a good report with a detailed analysis approach ('Bitcoin, A First Assessment' by Bank of America Merrill Lynch ) that seeks to clarify the risks and opportunities of this virtual phenomenon. According to Merrill Lynch, assuming Bitcoin becomes a widespread means of payment for transfers and e-commerce, an approach to its valuation could be reached through the addition of: - The average capitalization of established means of payment such as Western Union, MoneyGram and Euronet, c$4.5 billion . - The expectation that Bitcoin could capture 10% of global e-commerce, and the U.S. investment bank estimates this at $ 5 billion . That is, around $9.5 billion capitalization, ie, below the market level, which stands above $13 billion. The first part of the valuation analysis seems appropriate in a conservative scenario, but some could say that Bitcoin, having the benefit of a restricted supply, should capitalize above Western Union. But it is the second part of the sum which is more complex to analyse. To reach $5 billion, Merrill Lynch assumes that Bitcoin would accumulate 10% of on-line residential sales in the U.S., and extrapolates it to the rest of the world. In the U.S. the total e-commerce market is $224 billion and the domestic sector (households) accounts for approximately $10 billion, of which 10% would potentially be absorbed by Bitcoin. If we assume that the U.S. is close to 20% of global GDP and a similar degree of penetration of both trade and on-line commerce of Bitcoin in the world, Merrill's analysts arrive at the figure of $5 billion capitalization. However, according to my own analysis, that number could be much higher if we include companies using Bitcoin aggressively. If we add companies with 10% implementation, this part could reach $50 billion capitalization, assuming other electronic payment penetration levels. Such an assessment would indicate that Bitcoin is either nearly 30% above its fundamental value, or up to 420% undervalued , depending on the penetration assumptions. That is the dilemma of analysing Bitcoin, to understand the ability to penetrate markets that today are huge and where a space can be generated for this method of payment without falling into the risks of: - Being a threat to states and their control over currency and the money supply. In a world where central banks and governments have made financial repression as a last resort to support excessive debt spending, the use of legislation to attack any means that threatens their main weapon of economic policy should not be underestimated. Bitcoin, even in the middle of the valuation range, would be far from becoming a 'problem' like that. - Confiscation of assets Roosevelt-style as we have seen in the past with gold, and other paradigms of government actions to steal the savings of investors in 'safe havens'. Being a virtual asset makes this very difficult, but not impossible. For Bitcoin to be a bubble, global electronic commerce estimates should be much lower than the current maximum capitalization, ie the perception of demand unachievable in a fairly conservative analysis. That risk is not there looking at sales trends of global on-line commerce. In addition, to be a bubble, Bitcoin should meet the requirement of having a rapid and increasing supply well above demand. Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million by 2140. To be a Ponzi scheme it should meet the following criteria: - That profitability granted to existing holders of Bitcoin is 'guaranteed' and coming from the additional coins purchased by new investors, ie, to make the basis of 'new investors' only growing. That is not the case, the valuation of Bitcoin it fixed by demand and supply generated by a multitude of buyers and sellers, and sellers have no false guarantee or allegedly safe "return". - That price dynamics is uniform, opaque, controlled by a single operator and providing a false sense of 'security', ie it only goes 'up' until new buyers stop falling in the pyramid scheme and it explodes. Bitcoin buyers are aware of the volatility and possibility of selling at a loss. Bitcoin has seen huge rises in price and massive  falls, it behaves more like a financial start-up, an asset where price is being checked every day according to the potential supply and demand. Therefore, it is not like a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin, for valuation purposes, is equivalent to a tech startup or a junior explorer-miner. Its value only transpires when it begins to dispel doubts about its implementation as a combination of means of payment and safe haven. To achieve the potential and penetration needed to justify much higher prices, there are two things to look for: - The enormous volatility, with moves of 30-40% in one day, makes it difficult for large companies and massive consumers to accept it quickly. Volatility itself prevents its penetration into the mass market. To be a universally accepted means of payment it should have similar levels of volatility to those established currencies or gold. That's why I say it's still not a currency, but a volatile financial asset . - The length and quality of exchange. Bitcoin has a major advantage, supply is limited, and to avoid manipulation by a bank or state, there is no centralized validation system (clearing) that is why each transaction is analysed and delayed, to avoid double counting. Well, for large transactions this means a wait of up to fifty minutes until a payment is confirmed, which greatly limits the mass deployment in companies and trade. Furthermore, several of the servers have been 'hacked'. One such exchange, Bitcoinica lost 18,547 bitcoins after a cyber attack. BIPS in Europe lost 1,195 after a security issue. When transactions are immediate, safe and not subject to huge volatility, valuation of Bitcoin could start to make sense. There are still many doubts to clarify. If you find it difficult to understand the phenomenon, it is best to avoid it, not ride a wave dependent on variables with huge fluctuations. I don't own any Bitcoin. I always thought that if something has a gazillion percent of upside potential, I may let the first massive rise to those that accept the risk that goes from 'experiment' to 'reality'. What I find interesting is that Bitcoin shows that more people are scared and looking for ways to get out of the vicious circle of financial repression and devaluation of currencies. The implementation of an 'intervention-free currency' or means of payment can only be positive. And, if Bitcoin or any other free currency ends up being widely used, it may restore sanity to those governments that engage in this race of currency destruction they want to sell us as 'social' and that in reality is just a massive transfer of wealth from savers to the indebted states. ]] Brent - WTI differential shrunk recently from $20 to $11.5/bbl. WTI rallied due to the Keystone line fill. Before the pipeline goes into service it needs to be filled up with oil (600kbpd) so there is a continuous flow once it starts up. The pipeline is 485 miles long and goes from Cushing, OK to Nederland, TX. Careful, this is a technical and temporary effect. Meanwhile Brent lost some strength on prospects of rising Libyan crude supply as exports are being restored. An agreement was reached this week between the leaders of tribes disrupting eastern ports' operations and the government, which could allow exports from the currently closed ports, including Brega, Es-Sider, Marsa al-Hariga Zueitina, combined capacity 600,000b/d, to resume on Sunday. The IEA adjusted upwards 2013 and 2014 oil demand estimates on the back of stronger than expected actual data for Europe and the US. 2013 demand forecast now 91.2m b/d, 2014 92.4m b/d. IEA also adjusted up the non-OPEC supply estimates. Overall neutral to the oil price. The market remains very well supplied (as I noted here ). In terms of supply, the agency noted that one should not expect a rebound in Iranian exports with the current provisional agreement (capped at 1 mb/d), and that the development of production requires several investments which will take time to take shape. For the time being, despite the situation in Libya, the market remains well supplied given that the production increase in non-OPEC countries; the call on OPEC in 2014 has remained stable at 29.3 mb/d. Non-OPEC surges to 56.2mmb/d in November. Non-OPEC production surged 470kb/d MoM to 56.2mmb/d in November, and up 1.9mmb/d YoY. FY13 non-OPEC production is on track for the largest YoY gain in percentage terms since 2002 at +2.6%. The IEA kept its forecast for non-OPEC production essentially unchanged for 2014 at 56.5mmb/d, up 1.7mmb/d YoY (+3.1%). All in all, the system has excess oil supply of 0.4mmb/d for 2013, and expected c 0.7mmb/d for 2014. Mexico passed its energy reform bill yesterday opening up its oil industry to outside investment for the first time in 75 years. Companies will be offered production sharing contracts, which could result in a resurgence in Mexican oil production, but it will take several years and tens of billions to happen. Mexico's crude production has declined to c2.5mmbpd from 3.5mmbpd in the past years due to poor investment. I bet Mexico doesn't return to 3.5mmbpd quickly in the next years. Coal rose to $84.5/mt on renewed concerns of high increase in vessel freight rates for coal in 2014, driving traders to add to stocks. Australian exports still offset winter demand growth. However, according to the WSJ, global coal consumption could grow as little as 2% a year through 2017 in the face of weakening Chinese demand, mentioning the International Energy Agency's most recent coal-market report. Long-term estimates for Chinese coal demand, for the year 2035, range from 3.66 billion tons of coal equivalent, up from 2.29 billion tons in 2010, to as low as 1.51 billion tons, depending on Beijing's environmental policies. IEA medium term coal market report: . Coal demand is to grow at 2.3% CAGR over 2013-18 vs 2.7% previously assessed and 3.4% over 2007-2012. . China is to account for 60% of new global demand, without reaching its peak within the next 5 years. . India will rival China as the top importer in the next 5 years. . Despite the slightly slower pace of growth, however, coal will meet more of the increase in global primary energy than oil or gas. CO2 at 4.9/mt stays weak after the market discounted the EU backloading vote, which addresses little of the oversupply of EUAs. The EU Parliament voted through the approval for the backloading of 900m tn of CO2 permits.  Backloading anyway doesnt address the structural oversupply that exists in the ETS of more than 2b tn. Following that another vote is due by the EU Ministers next week (December 16th) and then the Environment Committee will have to go over the details with another vote at the EU Parliament for final approval due next year. The EU is aiming for March/April finalisation. US gas has strengthened to $4.25/mmbtu after three consecutive weeks of tightening inventories, reducing the gas glut. Storage this week fell 81bcf, bullish versus the 5-year average of a 64bcf withdrawal. Since September, weather has been 2% colder than the 5-year average. Over the last month, the weather adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been just 2.6bcf/d less than the 5-year average. Producer discipline is being evident, although not as one would expect. This week lower 48 States production fell just 0.8% (0.58 bcf/d). Louisiana had the largest volumetric decrease at 5.3% (0.34bcf/d) due to maintenance normal well decline. Wyoming dropped 5.9% (0.33bcf/d) primarily because of a gas plant being shut down for most of the month. Gulf of Mexico production rose 6% (0.2 bcf/d) having completed platform and pipeline maintenance performed last month. Production, however, keeps rising year-on-year. UK gas remains rangebound at 70.15p/therm (-0.07%), and I expect it to remain rangebound as inventories stay unchanged and weather is milder. Storage remains at 4,394mcm and volumes from Norway into Langeled pick up 3.8% this week. Power prices drop throughout the EU as industrial production disappoints again. Eurozone Industrial Production in October was -1.1% vs expectations of +0.3% (Prev. -0.5%, Rev. -0.2%). Here are the scary figures of power demand in Europe: We had Italian power demand data this week and it came much worse than expected (-2% in November, -3.5% yoy), driven by poor industrial demand. Thermal production was down 2.4% in November and 13% year to date due to increased geothermal, wind and solar production and to offset the lower demand. Solar production increased by 16.9% (ytd +18.5%), wind was up 15.7% (ytd +19.5%) and geothermal +10.2% (ytd +1.5%). Pool prices in Spain have risen almost 9% recently on lower hydro. The National Commission for Competition and Markets (CNMC) have opened an investigation into possible manipulation of the electricity pool prices, with the pool having seen a significant rise in prices in recent days, just ahead of the Cesur auction via which the energy component of the tariff is set. High prices in the electricity pool paralyse 21 electricity intensive factories, with the Association of Large Electricity Consumes talking of industrial alarm. ]] Government outlays undermine actual savings. The larger the outlays are, the more actual savings are diverted from wealth generators - Frank Shostak The economic news of the week in Europe have reduced the euphoria about a possible recovery. France went into recession in the third quarter and general Eurozone data is weaker than expected. In my new book Journey to Economic Freedom (Deusto) I devoted a chapter to the mistakes in economic policies of many countries in the European Union, because they were copied from France. Stagnation, high taxation and lack of reforms.  In order to maintain at all costs a hypertrophied state and bloated administrations, funds are spent on useless schemes at the expense of those  who generate wealth. At the smallest hint of a recovery we see that countries, instead of continuing with reforms, decide to relax and fall back into recession. And now governments are worried about...deflation. Why? Let's see... Risk for peripherals The risk to the recovery of Spain and peripheral Europe could come from an impact on exports. Spain exported to the larger economies of Europe 50% of its goods. In the first half of 2013, an increase of 8% of exports in Spain, although sales to France fell 1.7% to Germany 0.6% and Italy 0.4%. Seems some peripherals depend less on the EU partners to export. Foreign investment in Spain between January and June 2013 also shows an important differentiator component on the past. Foreign investment of residents (ie, Spaniards bringing outside money) is only 4.9% of the total, so 95.1% comes from foreign investors . However, in the interviews I've had this week the question that was repeated again and again was that the greatest concern regarding the stagnation of the EU is the "risk of deflation." First we must clarify that in most European countries and in Spain there is no deflation, there is disinflation due to badly managed industrial plans and overcapacity . When you have invested (spent) hundreds of billions of euros in "industrial plans" and productive capacity, especially in energy, car industry, textile, retail and infrastructure, what we are experiencing is a reduction of prices due to competition between oversized sectors, an overcapacity of up to 40% in some cases. On the other hand, inflation exists in other elements, very relevant to the industry and consumption, such as energy costs. The "alleged risk of deflation" is the excuse of governments to justify greater financial repression . Trying to create false inflation through rate cuts while citizens have less purchasing power, or through monetary stimulus plans when taxes rise leads nowhere. Look at Japan, 17 consecutive months of real wage reductions. Prices fall because we built massive productive capacity for a demand that never arrived and because the disposable income of citizens has been destroyed by confiscatory taxation. To reactivate the economy governments should return money to the pockets of citizens who have stoically accepted and paid interventionist policies and supported schemes and incentives that have led the EU to spend up to 3% of GDP to destroy 4.5 million jobs and sink the economy. The economy is still not recovering in Europe, the transmission belt for monetary policy is broken, debt, both in relative and absolute terms, continues to grow, employment is not improving and now they tell us that we enter into deflation. First, credit to the private sector still has not improved because all available credit is crowded out by government debt, making the financial system more risky and therefore more fragile against any sovereign risk. Wages are still falling, and to think that forcing Germany to stimulate its domestic demand will have a ripple effect on the periphery is wrong empirically, as we mentioned in this column some months ago, where we showed that the multiplier effect of attracting foreign capital and direct financial investment is three times higher than internal domestic demand stimulus. This disinflation, the European Japanisation of which I already warned in 2012 is a dire consequence of interventionist policies, which lead to de-industrialization and demand collapse. Combating possible deflation risk with more interventionist policies while still curtailing the consumption capacity of citizens with higher taxes only leads us to enlarge the debt hole. In addition, the voices calling for monetary stimulus forget that the velocity of money, which measures economic activity, collapses, creating a transfer of money to financial assets, stocks and bonds, but the collapse of productive investment. According to Citigroup , the velocity of money in the United States  and United Kingdom has fallen to levels of the mid-60s while nominal GDP is at 2001 levels. But the stock market is at historic highs and high risk bonds, at minimum yields. That is, we create 'wealth illusion' in financial risk assets while sustaining GDP artificially, but destroy wealth creation and employment . We have to stop the vicious circle of spending, debt, impoverishment, financial repression, less wealth, less investment, higher unemployment and more spending and pass into a virtuous cycle of saving, budgetary restraint, improved disposable income, consumption , investment and employment. Prosperity does not come from unicorn breeding, but consumption and productive investment.]] 1) "Winter Symphony" (Brian Wilson, "Christmas Album" (Extended Edition) by The Beach Boys). Brian Wilson was going through a rough period in the mid 70s, locked in his home, not daring to leave, battling the demons of drugs, mental illness and an abusive environment. However, in the 70s he sporadically wrote gems like this evocative Christmas song, particularly coming from a person who has never lived outside of California. This song remained unpublished and only available on bootlegs for many years. For me one of Brian Wilson's masterpieces. We love you, Brian! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0BVypgYrxo "Somewhere children outside, Screamin' down a daredevil slide, Rosy-cheeked bundles of cold-weather clothes." 2) "Do They Know It's Christmas" (Band Aid single ) Bob Geldof ( Boomtown Rats ) and Midge Ure ( Ultravox ) composed one of the few Christmas songs that does not fall into empty cliches, and one of the catchiest choruses in pop history. Although the artists involved have done more damage to the ozone layer with their hairspray excess than the entire coal industry, this song is just perfect. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE "And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas / The greatest gift they'll get this year is life." 3) "Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)" (The Ramones, single ) The Ramones were not at their best artistic moment when they released this single, but they made ??a hymn to reconciliation and forgiveness, with a catchy melody that reminded us of their three first great and essential albums. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y5GtaTrPHM "I loved you from the start/ 'cause Christmas is not the time for breaking each other's hearts." 4) "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" (John Lennon, single ) + "Once Upon A Long Ago" (Paul McCartney, All The Best! ) The Beatles, together and separately, made ??several Christmas songs. Together, "Christmas Time Is Here Again", is not among their best. It is a simple and fun song, but nothing else. George Harrison made ??the terrible "Ding Dong Ding Dong" and Ringo Starr recorded several pop carols with mixed results ("I Wanna Be Santa Claus" being the best). But it was John Lennon with "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" the one that recorded the best Beatles' Christmas song. Paul McCartney made ??many, with Wings and solo (which comes to being the same thing). My favourite is not his biggest holiday hit "Wonderful Christmastime", but the darker and more pessimistic "Once Upon A Long Ago". http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Vfp48laS8 "So this is Xmas, And what have you done, Another year over and a new one just begun." http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBsSUptatMw "Playing guitars on an empty stage, counting the bars of an iron cage, Tell me darling, what can it mean? Once upon a long ago, children searched for treasure." 5) 'Winter Wonderland "(Darlene Love, Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You") Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You" is the best pop Christmas album in history, no doubt for me. A genius at the top of his game. He might have been a tyrant and a murderer, but he was an amazing producer and composer. As any good dictator, he gathered in a single album all the bands and artists he worked with, and note after note, instrument after instrument, created an album that is still as exciting today as it must have been in its day. A friend gave it to me as a present and I thought "how tacky, an album of Christmas carols by 60s pop stars". How wrong I was. I appreciate it now as one of the best musical gifts ever. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAC3jp8Z5c4 "In the meadow we can build a snowman / Then pretend that he is Parson Brown / He'll say, "Are you married?" we'll say "No man, But you can do the job when you're in town!". 6) "Mistress for Christmas" (AC/DC "Razor's Edge") If you don't like AC/DC you will hate this song. Loud. Sexist. Politically incorrect. But if you do not like AC/DC you are the enemy, LOL. This song was recorded during their weakest artistic period, but concentrates all the best of the group. A killer riff murderer, a rowdy and politically incorrect lyric and a thundering beat. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOBUUhsRwc "I like female form in minimum dress, Money to spend with a capital "S", Get a date with the woman in red" 7) "Santa's Got An Airplane" (Beach Boys "Christmas Album, Christmas '77 and extended edition") When Brian Wilson, composer of all their hits, fell into depression and mental illness, the Beach Boys disappeared from the music world as a relevant act. During the mid 70's, Mike Love came up with the bright idea of recycling part of their flop disastrous albums, Landlocked, which was rejected by the record company, and MIU, best forgotten as it contains the worst songs in the band's history, and change the lyrics to Christmas songs. Unfortunately this 1977 Christmas album was also rejected and was not published until many years later. From this record you can save this wonderful song, combining crazy hippy messages, drug references and nods to Christmas. Essential. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aHGvdamu1I "He skydives down to the chimney with Ease / Parachutes a package to the whole family / It's Santa's Air Special delivery to under your tree." 8) "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (Bruce Springsteen, live single 1978) How great is the Boss?. Taken from one of his concerts in 1978, when the E Street Band was in the prime of its strengths, this fun version of the classic Christmas song concentrates in a few minutes all the reasons why Springsteen and his group were the best live experience in Rock between 1975 and 1985. May Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici rest in peace, they made ??us happy for decades. Today the band is still excellent, but these memories... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rebS3FABeck "He sees you when you're sleeping / He knows when you're awake / He knows if you've been bad or good, So be good for goodness sake". 9) 'Father Christmas' (The Kinks, single ) It is curious that this list of great Christmas songs includes many tracks created during periods of low creativity and slump in popular success for some of the bands. The holiday muse seems to appear when the gold records become plywood ones. This song is another example. The Kinks were in a period of popularity downturn but their albums and lyrics were still wonderful. Ray Davies delivers one of his best and most cynical lyrics, removing the cliches of syrupy Christmas spirit. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-oVPVsCqs4 "Father Christmas, give us some money / Don't mess around with those silly toys / We'll beat you up if you do not hand it over / We want your bread so do not make us annoyed / Give all the toys to the little rich boys ". 10) "Christmas" (The Who's "Tommy") Pete Townshend wrote the first successful rock opera (not the first chronologically, the Pretty Things own that honour) and within it we can find this little song about Christmas for the deaf and mute boy, Tommy, as sung by his family. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDriHKfb6x8 "And Tommy doesn't know what day it is. He does not know who Jesus was or what praying is. How can he be saved? From the eternal grave." Other strong contenders: . Run Rudolph Run - Keith Richards or Lemmy Kilmister 's version .

John Paul Getty Fans of monetary stimulus always ignore the biggest and best push for the economy. Cheap energy. Finding oil and gas. The United States have achieved an economic stimulus equivalent to 1.3% of GDP thanks to the energy revolution brought by fracking. It is a very significant positive effect, both on the supply and demand side. - On the supply side, it has led the U.S. to be energy independent in gas and in oil very shortly. In October 2013, domestic crude oil production exceeded imports for the first time since 1995 (7.74 million barrels a day compared with imports of 7.57 million barrels per day). In fact, imports of crude oil in North America have dropped to the lowest level of the past 17 ??years. - On the demand side, although the economy is growing and industrial production increases, technological efficiency is improving consumption very significantly consumption. In 2008, the United States spent 10% of gross domestic product in energy. In 2013, it will not reach 8.5%. At the close of this article, the spread between U.S. benchmark oil (West Texas Intermediate) and the European benchmark (Brent) stood at nearly $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow to evacuate and export the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and that isolates the U.S. and Canada price as separate and autonomous market dynamics. The spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent is likely to remain at $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow evacuating and exporting the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and the Keystone filling is not enough to offset the rise of production. Total product demand in the US on a trailing four week basis is 20.1m b/d, +5.6% y/y. Gasoline demand is up 3.3%, distillate demand growth + 0.1% and jet fuel demand is up 8.1%. At 386mb crude stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range for December. Gasoline inventories are in the upper half of the average range. Distillate stocks are below the lower limit of the average range for this time of year. The price of gas in U.S. is $ 3.9/ mmbtu compared to the European average of $ 8.5 / mmbtu. More than twice. Meanwhile, in Japan, energy costs have skyrocketed in 2013 and the price at which the country imports liquefied natural gas exceeds $ 15/mmbtu ... five times more expensive than the U.S. gas. Not only the U.S. imports less, but the cost is lower than that of its competitors in the OECD countries. It is the way to energy independence in the U.S. I already commented in 2012 here. The effect produced by this energy revolution is twofold: - It greatly reduces the "geopolitical premium" to be added to the price of crude . Even though Brent reflects an obvious geopolitical risk, it is much smaller than in the past because the balance between supply and demand is very well covered. That the price of Brent is "only" $110 a barrel in an environment of decent demand growth and supply problems in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran is a clear proof of how well the market is supplied . Brent price dynamics is lateral, despite supply problems in Libya due to internal protests, which led the country to export less than 90,000 barrels per day (compared to the country's capacity of 1.25 million barrels per day), sanctions to Iran (which led the country to export about 1 million barrels a day, compared with its capacity of 2.5 million) and the political difficulties to boost production in Iraq after the war. In fact, Iraq is likely to slash its production guidance by 35%. Meanwhile, Iran is aiming at adding 500kbpd to supply, but technical challenges remain, more important than sanction lifting. At the OPEC meeting, Iran stated that it was ready to open its doors to the oil majors from Europe and the US, but the seven companies named by Iran to boost oil output are unanimously sceptical about the growth targets set by the country (BP, RDS, Total, ENI, Statoil, Exxon and Conoco). Not only the spare capacity of OPEC countries is adequate to address specific risks, but the oil price still includes a negative impact of production incidents - unexpected cuts to supply from military or political crises - of 2.7 million barrels a day. If those unexpected cuts are normalized, the geopolitical premium in oil prices will fall further . OPEC held its meeting for the half year and, unsurprisingly, maintained its production quota of 30 mbpd. The return to normal production in Libya could add 1m bpd, but the future rise in production in Iraq is under threat, and I see it impossible to take the country's production from 3mbpd to 4mbpd in 2014 or mid-2015. A possible lifting of the embargo on Iran might enable the country to produce and export an additional 500kbpd. As such, it is virtually impossible that, even with Libya and Iran returning, OPEC production would reach 33 mb/d. Therefore the call on OPEC stays at 29-30 mbpd in 2014. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Emirates are expected to balance the market cutting part of the production that they increased to offset the Iran embargo. It requires a maximum cut of 1.1mbpd to tighten the market aggressively. There is enough spare capacity and the incremental production comes from so-called "safe" countries, the U.S. in particular. Of the newly added production capacity in the oil value chain -1.3 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.7 million in 2014- most comes from North America (including Canada), at a low cost and with an EROEI higher than 8x, ie, competitive and sustainable. This creates greater stability and less risk. It is an environment where price is acceptable for producers and consumers, where the "oil burden" in the OECD -cost of foreign-imported oil- does not reach 6.5% of gross domestic product. The possibility of excess supply in the next three years is not small. There is plenty of oil and the extra barrels that arrive to the system come from countries with lower political difficulties. The EIA (Energy Information Administration) announced that in the second quarter of 2013 global oil production exceeded demand. Although this dynamic might change, as many analysts expect, it will not get to 55% of the average difference between consumption and production of the last five years. In my opinion, the supply of crude oil and liquids will probably exceed demand growth estimates -1.1 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.2 in 2014 -. Why? Because this increase depends critically on China to continue to grow in a way that many consider questionable, as I explained in my article "Careful with China", and the "efficiency" effect is already part of the policy of the Chinese Communist Party itself. Crude imports from China fell by 13.8% in 2013 (4.8 million barrels/day to October). What does this mean? The incremental oil demand comes mostly from emerging countries which , as we all know, tend to suffer abrupt periods of expansion and decline. In fact, my estimates of demand growth indicate an extremely modest increase, which would lead to oil prices evolving with little more than inflation. That the OECD is facing a mid-term future where oil-price shocks are becoming less frequent and have less impact, as the effect of new technologies -renewables- and efficiency take hold. The surprise may be that in 2014 crude prices continue losing that "geopolitical premium" while the US energy revolution continues. A "real stimulus" for OECD countries. Yes, I know, the naysayers will say that oil is running out, that liquids do not count, that all is a lie, that demand will always grow as if technology and efficiency were inexistent, but the reality is different. The last barrel of oil will not cost millions of dollars. It will be worth zero. Because by then, if the threats of depletion were remotely true-and they are not- oil would have been replaced as major source of energy. Never bet against human ingenuity. Even the most optimistic would have never estimated the success of the energy revolution that has occurred in the U.S.. The oil market is well supplied and the impact of shocks is falling. I am sorry for the naysayers, doom-forecasters, we are going to have plenty of oil for many, many decades. For companies, dividends are under threat: Over the last 4 quarters, Europes five oil majors have generated negative Free Cash Flow of -$1.5bn and declared dividends of $35bn. In the long run, this situation is not sustainable. If we exclude the US oil supermajors, which spend 25bn in buybacks from Free Cash Flow, the sector generates negative Free Cash Flow at $110/bbl, particularly the national oil companies, including Petrobras and Petrochina. The problem is refining and high taxation (that is why US companies do better on FCF yield despite losing money on shale gas). At the same time,  for European companies, capex has continued to surprise on the upside, leading to an increase in one-year forward consensus expectations from ~$105bn at the end of 2011 to the current level of ~$125bn. This has been driven by further cost inflation, but also an increase in the investment opportunities that are accessible to the oil majors, largely as a result of unconventional projects including shale gas. After a period of being opportunity-constrained, in the mid-2000s, the sector is currently opportunity-rich, and oil companies have clearly been eager to capitalize on this. Global capex in Upstream remains above $600 billion a year, which is critical to the continuing super cycle of services. It is not a question of cost, safety in a post Macondo world and unit costs (service charges have dropped to less than 20% of overall project costs despite a massive increase in projects, margins and investment, this is because projects are larger, more complex and more skewed to non-conventional). The oil and gas upstream capex cycle remains at the core of the overall supply cycle and is divided into six different market activities each of which has its own balance of supply, demand and inventories. 1. Acquiring/relinquishing acreage (flat in 2014 at $150bn) 2. Acquiring an inventory of seismic knowledge (on the rise) 3. Exploratory drilling-designed to find new resources (on the rise) 4. Delineation drilling  designed to prove up reserves (on the rise) 5. Development  huge capital deployment to bring proved reserves to market (flat) 6. Deciding on whether to extend the life of producing properties, or whether to prematurely abandon them.(flat) Exploration capex is likely to rise for the first time in 10 years above $160bn, which is a very positive scenario for drillers and seismic. So how does this play out positively for services if clients-companies are not generating FCF at $110/bbl and capex is at all-time high?. When deciding to cut capex, oil companies always start with the largest part (35%) items 5 and 6, but the other elements are largely against companys targets, interests and competitive position if they are cut. This underpins my view that the super cycle in services remains in 2014 despite a flat oil price environment. And I believe companies will address the imbalance in Free Cash Flow cutting dividends, not capex (as highlighted in 3Q results). More read: CNBC ]] The United States has had five years of elevated joblessness and subpar growth - John Cassidy In 1982,  Fleetwood Mac released an album called "Mirage", giving a false impression of collaboration and partnership between the turmoil, hatred and grudges. Nevertheless, it sold several million copies. The mirage of our days may be the expectation of 2.9% growth in the United States in 2014. And it also sells a lot. The US is growing. All is well. Unemployment is low. Expansionary policy works. Does it? Not only it is not, but the most important economists of the Federal Reserve are warning about it. Look at yesterday's GDP by categories: The "headline" +3.6% growth hides a meagre +1.9% ex-inventories. Q3 Consumer Spending +1.4%, was the weakest since December 2009. Business Inventory added 1.7% to +3.6% GDP, the most since 2011. In fact, real final sales (core GDP, ex-inventories) was actually revised down to just 1.9%. (Graph from Business Insider) The Federal Reserve acknowledged in its last meeting that the macroeconomic data is still disappointing, with weak growth and poor employment. This graph shows it, but the stock market is rising and house prices are rocketing... "Perception of wealth" they call it. Sure, for those who already own stocks or property. Meanwhile more than 65% of property sales are made without mortgage... The perverse incentive to flood markets with easy money generates a massively leveraged economy (check margin debt, at record highs), moves capital to the financial sector and sinks productive investment. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is becoming more like a souffle , filled with air . Not only companies spend less, but the money is used to buy back stock, pay dividends and exchange capital in mergers and acquisitions, and not for added productive investment. Between 1996 and 2006 the largest companies in the U.S. (S P 500) invested about one trillion dollars per year, of which 70% was devoted to capex and RD while 30% to buyback and dividends. Since 2009 the annual number of total invested capital has soared to over $2.3 trillion, but 45% is used to buy back shares and pay dividends. In fact, neither the figure of productive investment or RD have increased substantially, inflation-adjusted, since 1998. That is, the 'free' money from the expansionary policy is used  for protection, reducing the number of outstanding shares, merge and return cash to shareholders, not to expand organically  (data from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley). The U.S. has created nearly half of all the money supply of its history in the past five years, and has lived the longest period ever seen without raising interest rates, and yet the labour participation rate (percentage of civil population of the United States with over 16 years of age or more who have a job or are actively looking for one) has fallen to 1978 levels, 62.8%. Some explain this due to "the demographic effect". However, adjusting for these demographic changes -there are fewer young workers and the older ones are living longer-, the labour force participation and employment has not improved since 2010 while the country engaged in money printing like crazy. Improving unemployment by 'taking people off the lists', as in Europe in the early 90s. Meanwhile, almost half of the working population in the U.S. earns less than $40,000 per annum. From Michael Purves: "Payrolls this week report came in with an impressive 203k gain and a 7.0% unemployment print. More importantly the jobs additions drew from a wide variety of sectors, including manufacturing, and not the lower wage and more temporary job additions we have seen in earlier reports. The underemployment rate (U-6) also fell from 13.8% to 13.2%, representing the sharpest percentage drop  since 2008.   The most significant aspect of this report is not the numbers per se, but that the numbers were achieved in the context of notably higher interest rates.  However, there are still notable signs of  weakness: the participation rate (despite an uptick this morning) is still in a down trend, and we are still not seeing a significant improvement in average hourly earnings, or average weekly hours". Additionally, personal income decreased 0.1% and disposable personal income (DPI) decreased 0.2% in October. Monetary policy is proving to be a key driver of massive inequality, and benefiting only those that held assets or have access to massive debt. The greatest swindle since the miracle medicine men of the Wild West is to say that monetary policy is redistributive and social. But do not worry, they say, "next year, it will be better", "Just wait." Look at the Hiring Plans Index since 2011 (graphs from MS). The balance of the U.S. Federal Reserve is rapidly approaching a staggering $4 trillion dollars, buying about a billion a year in bonds, yet the economy is growing well below its potential ... but also that potential is deteriorating . QE does not create jobs exhibit 1: Exhibit 2: Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion vs Job Creation In the last two weeks I've read two excellent reports from Federal reserve economists William English and David Wilcox warning about the deterioration of the actual and potential growth of the United States. The  graph of one of these reports shows how the correlation between potential and real GDP has broken, well below the trend from 2000 to 2007. Companies do not invest in productive activities and job creation because conditions for confidence are simply not there. Artificially low rates and printing money may deceive a few analysts, but not presidents and CEOs of companies that have been able to be leaders and global competitors despite any government interference. Tax increases and financial repression destroy consumption, money velocity and job creation in the medium term. Goldman Sachs estimates that in 2014 capex and productive investment will grow by 9%. Analysing estimates and guidance for 2014 of most SP 500 companies, I doubt it. At best, it will be flat year-on-year. Government cannot replace private sector capex. Despite the low government bond yields and eternal lift of the debt ceiling, the U.S. continues to generate a massive deficit, projected at around $744 billion for Fiscal Year 2014. To 'fill' the loss of productive investment, assuming -which is a lot- that governments would spend wisely- the deficit would have to shoot another half a trillion dollars, and with it comes higher tax increases, more financial repression and... less productive investment. True, banks are stronger and have less risk and government is borrowing at low rates. Of course they are, with a QE that is an equivalent of 6.7% of US GDP as an annual gift. Increasing money supply by 6-7% to grow GDP by 2% is not growth, it's stretching the pizza dough. However, a problem of wrong incentives, creating fake money and artificially low rates not only dilutes the real growth but impairs its potential one. The solution that Keynesian economists offer? ... Repeat. "Until investors give in" as Paul Krugman says. More fuel to the fire. As growth is poor, what they propose is more booze to the alcoholic. Low rates forever. Yes, many members of the U.S. central bank, like Charles Plosser,  expressed doubts about the effectiveness of monetary policy, and begin to propose measures to control the madness limiting the ability of the Fed to buy assets and expand its balance sheet, but these are still voices in the desert. If you really think that forcing the machine will revive investment and job creation because it is decided by a committee, it will not happen. Until the job creators clearly see the opportunities, investment will remain low. Reasons for concern: - Credit conditions are deteriorating alarmingly, which leads me to believe that productive investment will stagnate in 2014 . Estimates of increase of 9% do not agree with any of the messages thrown by the companies that published results and guidance. - Deterioration of the leading indicators of job creation, new businesses, corporate margins and capex have accelerated since September and came into contraction long before the government shutdown. - Estimates of profits in the industrial and consumer sector have fallen between 8% and 10% for 2014. - In March, another drama on account of the debt ceiling and overspending  and no small risk of tax hikes. With the popularity of President Obama at a minimum-37% -, the likelihood of tax increases to 'the rich', which is always translated into 'tax hikes for all', is high. - The so-called Obamacare -mistakenly sold as the panacea of universal public health-, means about 52 billion dollars in new taxes to small businesses in particular, and the lowest estimate of the negative impact on employment that I have read is 800,000 people . Yes, I know. For the stock market investor most of this is irrelevant. The worse, the better, and $85 billion of monthly asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, even if it is trimmed, makes everyone happy because the 'helicopter money' only helps the financial sector and the state, so we will 'party like it's 1999' for a while. Furthermore, investors are protected by many companies who do not fall into the trap of easy money, because they are the first to suffer when the music stops. I am sure that the innovative spirit of the country will prevail, but to estimate its economic development through the moves of a stock market impacted by share repurchases and 'laughing gas money' may be an illusion. Richard Koo warned that the U.S. is engaged in "the QE trap" from which you can not get out easily or comfortably. As Fleetwood Mac ... Can't Go Back.

Capesize rates have fallen 48% in a week to $17k per day. This has been driven by spot chartering falling to 72 vessels relative to the highs of 161 vessels chartered seen at the peaks in December. - . Iron Ore imports are on hold after stockpiles in major Chinese ports have gone to 82mt versus 71mt average in 2013. Chinese crude steel output has fallen driven by pollution control measures as well. . Panamax rates have fallen 7% in a week due to the suspension of Colombian coal shipments until March by Drummond, the worlds 4 th largest coal exporter. - . Crude tanker rates (VLCCs) have fallen 28% in a week to $30k per day, as vessels to the US are reducing given lower imports. These moves justify the decline back to September levels, as the previous increases arrived from short term big rate improvements driven by re-stocking in India and China and an increase in refinery utilization and oil imports- from the US. In essence, rates are returning to a normalized level of small improvement from the lows but a shipping environment that is still oversupplied and global commerce is not improving drastically , and definitely not even close to 2007 levels. The moves up in rates in October-December were driven by one-off events that drove to a short-term tightness in very particular segments (Capesize and Panamax). ]] Brent down 3.2% MTD at c$107/bbl. WTI at $94/bbl (-4%). Differential has settled around $13/bbl. US production at a 25-year high. Global oil supply at 92.23m b/d, up 1.16m b/d or 1.3% y/y. Within this OPEC supplies increased 310k b/d m/m to 29.82m b/d on higher output from Saudi Arabia the UAE. Iraq was the only member to post a monthly decline in December. Effective spare capacity is estimated at 3.33m b/d in Dec. Non-OPEC supplies declined 340k b/d in Dec to 55.99m b/d, with Brazilian ethanol production responsible for most of the decline. In November US oil production exceeded 8m b/d level for the first time since 1988, with the main drivers being Texas shale plays, a return of Gulf of Mexico output from maintenance and a solid contribution from Alaska. Crude has been helped by stronger product demand as the US prepared for another cold snap. China GDP data released early this morning shows GDP for 4Q at +7.7% vs market at 7.6%. Data also shows December oil demand down 10.6% and a Reuters calculation has China crude demand for 2013 up a small 1.6%. In Libya there are reports of fighting in the south with the government using its airforce to bomb fighters it claims are loyal to the former Gadaffi regime while plans are now being prepared by the government to re-take eastern export terminals currently under the control of rebels. CFTC data released on Friday for the week to 14 Jan showed speculators cutting net long futures/options positions by 16,568 to 281,802 contracts. US refinery utilization stands at 90.0% vs. a 5-year average of 84.9%. 4-week average gasoline demand was up 3.0% YoY, and 4-week average distillate demand was up 10.3% YoY. Coal is up 4% this month at $86.60/mt driven by Chinese data showing solid but lower growth. Looks at risk of de-rating from here. China expects total energy consumption to rise 3.5% y-o-y in 2014  NEA forecasts Chinas total energy consumption may rise to 3.89bt of std. coal in 2014, assuming energy elasticity down to 0.43 from 0.506 in 2013. And the share of non-fossil and natural gas consumption could reach 10.7% and 6.1%. CO2 is flat this month at v5.05/mt. A  leaked document claims that on 22nd Jan the EU will suggest reform of the CO2 market should centre on a market stability reserve to enable the market to better adjust to economic changes, but only from 2021. Hard to see that near-term impacting prices much. US gas has been flat at $4.2/mmbtu. Total working storage is now at 2,530 Bcf, 659 Bcf below last year's 3,189 Bcf and 443 Bcf below the 5-year average of 2,973 Bcf. Despite record withdrawals, supply-demand balance remains ample. UK gas is down 2% at 66p/therm. Storage is at 4,011mcm (84.34% full), unlikely to drive prices higher. Power prices in Europe do not improve... As industrial demand and thermal capacity continue to erode peak pricing power. Germany at 36.95/mwh and Nordpool at 33.85/mwh ]] US gas ends the year as the king of commodities, up 19% YTD at $4.31/mmbtu as the injection trend reversed to a bullish storage withdrawal in the past two months. Looking to 2014, exports + coal plant retirements adding 3bcf/d of demand keep me confident of improvi ng US gas prices. Total working storage is now at 2,974 Bcf, 562 Bcf below last year's 3,536 Bcf and 289 Bcf below the 5-year average of 3,263 Bcf. Oil ends the year as the only other commodity up yoy. Brent up 7% ytd at $111.38/bbl an d WTI at $99m14/bbl. The differential at $12.25. Demand growth has been better than expected and supply disruptions took 800kbpd of oil in the system. Looking to 2014 I see less supply risks and healthier demand, bringing the call on OPEC down to 29mmbpd. US will be the lion share of non-OPEC supply, keeping a wide WTI discount because of it. 2015 will see US as biggest oil producer above Saudi Arabia. UK gas at 69p/th ends the year up 6% yoy. The picture of tight supply and inventories plus most LNG absorbed by Japan will likely ease in 2014, to see a more moderate picture of supply-demand helped by cheaper spot LNG as japanese nuclear comes back gradually. Coal at $82.40/mt ends the year down 13.3% and 2014 sees a similar picture of oversupply and poor demand growth. Demand to increase by 1.5% versus supply at 3.5% is not bullish. CO2 crashed 30% in 2013 and ends saved partially by EU efforts to contain oversupply. At 4.67/mt, backloading only addressed a small part of the oversupply of EUAs and renewables continue to eat out of thermal generation while industrial production doesn't pick up in Europe. A flat 2014 is likely. German power prices at 36.70/mwh down 16% ytd, Nordpool at 32/mwh down 15% ytd... The picture is not bullish for 2014 because of the same reasons as CO2, but power prices seem to have bottomed out and the curve reflects a small inflation into 2015 as EU reduces commitment to Kyoto in favour of growth policies. 2014 doesn't look like a year of mass commodity inflation, which bodes well for the recovery, and prices remain attractive for consumers and producers. With the oil burden at less than 5-6% of global GDP and gas well supplied and within the trading range, it's a good environment for everyone without causing a 2008 supply shock that halts the economy. ]] The real goal should be reduced government spending, rather than balanced budgets achieved by ever rising tax rates to cover ever rising spending. Thomas Sowell Spanish bond yields have fallen to pre-crisis levels despite debt to GDP reaching c100%, a deficit that will be above the target 6.5% and refinancing needs of c224bn in 2014. The "Draghi put", added to much better comps on unemployment (fallen by 147k in 2013), consumer spending (+2% in December) and added to expectations of an 0.5%-1% growth in GDP have helped. But challenges remain. Debt (public and private above 300% of GDP), unemployment (26%) are still too high, and 0.5-1% growth is simply not enough. . Spanish banks dependence on the ECB will fall from the 220.5bn of November but is still very high. In that month the Spanish Banks long-term ECB borrowings dropped by 12.0bn. . Bank Non-Performing Loan Ratio. This ratio likely continued to rise in November (from 13.0% in October). In the next few months, the NPL ratio should continue to rise, although at a slower pace. . Taxes: 40 tax raises between 2011 and 2014. And raised again in the beginning of 2014 to try to collect one billion euro more, increasing Social Security contributions as well, affecting mostly SMEs and self-employed. Prime Minister Rajoy will be in Washington (13 and 14-January). On Monday he will meet with Christiane Lagarde just a few days before the IMF releases the update of its 2014 growth forecast. The IMF could raise its forecast for Spain from the current +0.2%. On Tuesday, he will meet with the US Chamber of Commerce. I read different analysis of Spain's growth potential. Among all OECD countries, Spain is the only one that shows more divergence between expected growth (+0.5-1%) and its potential (+3% according to BBVA, Goldman Sachs and Merill Lynch). This is the opportunity cost of holding on to the 2004 model of state intervention and bureaucracy. I estimate Spains growth for 2014 at 1% and assume 250k net job creation, but this is far away from its potential. Only by laying out the red carpet to job creation and improving the opportunities to do business, Spain would attract direct financial investments of 50 billion euro and would create much more new net jobs. By lowering SMEs and self-employed taxes, the UK did not only increase its revenue collection by 24 billion pounds, it also reduced the unemployment rate to 7%... being a net receiver of immigration. The formula: business is great and low taxes. Meanwhile, in Spain, we keep trying to hunt the unicorns of  recovering tax revenues and telling ourselves that we dont have a spending problem. At the peak of the real estate bubble Spain never collected more than 412 billion euro of tax revenues. However, it spends above 70 billion euro more than this historical high tax receipts of 2007, which will never return. A minimum of 30 billion euro per annum of higher expenses than bubble-peak revenues even if we deduct aid to banks and one-offs. I talk about it in my book Viaje a la Libertad Economica" ("Journey to economic freedom). In Spain, tax revenues have not collapsed because of fraud or the black economy, but due to the enormous dependency on construction and civil works which reached almost 20% GDP including services and grids for a demand growth that never arrived. A bubble of overcapacity to inflate artificially the country's GDP. And this GDP, artificially increased by stimulating internal demand brought as a consequence a 300% of debt. The problem is such inflated GDP figure (c20% according to independent analysts) is the same GDP that is used to tell us that the country collects less taxes than the other countries. Using ratios on the grounds of an artificial GDP to justify bubble spending and confiscatory taxes. It is the same subterfuge of me selling to myself something that I dont need and I cant afford, with debt, and then say that my business is growing, justifying by this way an unacceptable spending level. Spain's 2014 budget doesnt correct that spending problem yet, and public spending remains above 2007 levels, meanwhile families' disposable income and economic activity has fallen to 2004 levels, being optimistic. It's the public spend aristocracy. According to the 2014 Budget data Spain will be spending 10 billion euro in subsidies; 23 billion in coordination and finance relationships with territorial authorities; 690 million in State foreign action; 497 million in development cooperation; 131 million in cultural diffusion abroad; in peripheral State administration 275 million; in news coverage 55 million; another 83 million in meteorology (yes, I swear); actions to prevent climate change another 42 million; official cars spend raises 1.6% to 240 million; the mutual healthcare, which is parallel to public healthcare, means another 2 billion. Yet we hear that there is no scope for further cuts. But the problem is that we dont give solutions for the two problems which are obstructing the economic recovery: - A "Sheriffs of Nottingham" taxation system that is more worried about collecting the last coin and sustaining, at all cost, the unsustainable spending, instead of creating good conditions for economic growth and with them generate more tax revenues. When I read reform to increase tax bases reduce deductions it really means raise taxes. Spain is the country where fiscal pressure has increased more since 1965 after Turkey. Fiscal pressure at 40% ranks among the highest in the EU ( read here ) - Legal uncertainty perception. If the tax and legal environment are not clear and predictable it will be very hard to attract financial investment to create jobs and put capital in the economy for the long-term. Not to buy bonds and shares, but investing in sectors capable of making Spain recover real growth. If the system is seen ad unpredictable and risks of retroactive changes, long term investment doesn't arrive. Spain lost ten positions in the ranking of "doing business" of the Heritage Foundation (46 from 36 before). - Useless spend sustains a level of bureaucracy whose objective is to justify itself with endless rules (state, region, local) and ridiculous procedures. I recommend you to read the additional competences given to the regional authorities or the unproductive subsidies, for example. This bureaucracy and complexity acts as a block to new investment and job creation. Between 2008 and 2011 public spending in the Eurozone increased almost 7% to nearly 4.65 billion. In southern countries, the most affected by the so-called austerity, at least in theory, the evolution is similar: From 2008 public spending has grown 8.6% in France, 4% in Spain, 3% in Italy and 7.8% in Portugal. However, economic activity and disposable income have fallen to 2004 levels. Instead of considering that spending must be adapted to the economic cycles and that prosperity always had come from saving, we start to thinking that an excessive spending problem will be fixed with more spending. To spending there is always a reason, the "position rent" is created. Once this bureaucratic entity is created  justifying it is easier than restricting/cutting it. Look at Spain's loss-making public companies. Only four out of 4.000 have been closed. However, there is never a margin to lower taxes and boost the economy. There is nothing more permanent than a temporal raise of taxes. Then, when the country gets into depression, the "solution offered" is more public spending as the way out of the crisis which has been created by excessive spending in the first place. Everyone sees the enormous potential of Spain. Growing 1% in 2014 its fine. Thinking that this is enough and we dont have to reduce more superfluous spending is dangerous. 2014 will be much better than consensus estimates. I dont doubt it. But it could be much better. There is a huge potential and, if Spain wants, it can surpass it. Further read: "Spain, bottoming out" http://energyandmoney.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/spain-bottoming-out.html ]] This article as published in El Mundo Surely you have read that a bank intern at the City of London sadly died a couple of weeks ago after allegedly working 72 hours straight. Well, if you have read the chronicle of the press, you will probably be horrified at the description of "inhuman hours', deaths and suicide in the financial sector. Nothing is further from reality. In the City of London more than 450,000 people work in a very competitive, but free environment. Nobody is here by obligation. In fact, the vast majority of those who would like to join this sector never get the chance. We, in our fund, receive more than 50 job requests for each vacancy, and in some cases, such as large funds or investment banks, the figure is over 500 applications per job. Life in the City is tough, and employers demand results, as it should be. Imagine for a second that the person who manages your savings or your pension fund was remunerated by any other measure that was not profitability. Would you invest in this fund?. Work can be strenuous, but slavery-type hours and inhuman conditions are a fiction. Yes, the day begins very early, at six or seven o'clock. But anyone who takes the train at Waterloo Station or the tube at Bank or Liverpool Street knows that at five or six pm the vast majority of people are on their way home. What matters is the achievement of results and targets, and the time and hours used to get there depends on each one's time management. Everyone in the City has had to work long hours and several weekends, but so do entrepreneurs, writers, musicians and journalists. I'm afraid that behind the controversy over the City's death lies more demagoguery than real concern for working too hard. In the same way that no one questions an elite athlete who trains aggressively or a singer that makes 250 concert tours, it is normal for a competitive industry to have people that give their best. Professionals that go through a very thorough selection process and freely take the responsibility, because it is also a passion. This not only work. It is a meritocracy and competition is encouraged. The same thing that many call sacrifice is, for the vast majority in the City, a pleasure. Of course, if someone does not like this environment, he or she is free to resign, and his colleagues will be happy to wish him or her well in another sector. A few miles away across the Channel, France is apparently the model for many advocates of interventionism and government control. France Telecom, now Orange, is a global example of what many would consider a quiet and stable workplace. Semi-state owned, 35 hour weeks, ... a long-term safe environment. So long-term and safe that it is simply impossible to escape from it. In France Telecom, 35 people committed suicide between 2008 and 2009. Nothing is more inhuman than the frustration and despair of living the Kafkaesque nightmare of paperwork, mobbing, and tedious and pointless jobs. But that, of course, does not generate controversy, because that's what many try to sell us as a "good job". When I came to the City of London I was 36 years, I was no kid. Taking the decision was not easy. I went from being a director in a good company in a stable secure, low-risk environment, to a very competitive industry and a salary largely dependent on the achievement of objectives. Everyone around me said it was a mistake, a risky decision. Today, almost ten years later, people say we have been very lucky and it was a good decision. I have a full life, a wonderful family and my work is not a burden because I love it. The day it becomes a burden I will quit, and I'm sure there will be dozens of candidates happy to take my place. Freely. Working in the City is a conscious and free decision. Whoever does not like the system should not worry, because they would probably never be hired. However, between a free and competitive work environment and a safe but frustrating one, there is something that I have very clear: I would not trade freedom for security. Never.]] "The debt compromise is like eating a Satan sandwich" Emanuel Cleaver Yesterday I heard again a sentence that tends to be repeated frequently: "Deficits support growth". It assumes with his claim that increasing deficits helps economic recovery, rather than see that such recovery is much slower and fragile precisely because of the large deficits and the cost of financing them with taxes. The nascent recovery that I have been commenting for a few months has a very clear threat. The over-indulgence of debt accumulation just because cost is low, which leads us to the risk of spending a long time stuck in pedestrian growth levels. The argument in favour of forgetting the debt problem is heard every day.It goes like this: What matters is growth. As long as economies get out of recession, and cost of debt is low, governments should not worry, as little by little indebtedness will be reduced because the denominator, GDP, increases. All is fine. This argument has only three drawbacks: the saturation threshold, destructive debt and volatile cost of debt. . What is the threshold of debt saturation? I have mentioned it several times. The point at which an additional unit of debt does not  generate economic growth, but simply stagnates the economy further. This threshold was surpassed in the OECD, between 2005 and 2007. . What is destructive debt? It's the debt generated by unproductive current expenditure, which produces no positive effect on growth and perpetuates a system that confiscates and engulfs the real economy through taxes, detracting investment and annihilating consumption. In the European Union or the US, a structural deficit of nearly 4% of GDP. . Volatile cost of debt. What makes us think that bond yield and cost of debt are going to stay low forever? We have seen U.S. bond yields rise by 64% so far this year and German soar by 49%. Of course, from a very low level, but the reality is that bond yields can not be kept artificially low forever. And that's when e see debt shocks, because the outstanding debt accumulation increases while low yields are unsustainable. 'Cheap' public debt is not a free pass to spend. In fact 'cheap' is a misnomer, since it assumes that there is no cost of opportunity in private investing or saving. Cheap is dangerous. Think of the perverse situation in a country like Japan, with a debt of over 200% of GDP, where the country's financing needs are over 60% of GDP in 2013. Its ten year bond yields only 0.7%, so the country's incentive to reform is very low... because debt is cheap... Yet if there is an increase in the yield of a 100 basis points it would endanger the entire economy. Japanese public debt, cheap or expensive, is more than 24 times the country's fiscal revenues. On the debt saturation problem, Deutsche Bank recently showed the impact of the last five years: The G7 countries have added almost $18 trillion of debt to a record 140 trillion, with nearly five trillion from central banks' balance sheet expansion, to generate only a trillion dollars of nominal GDP. That is, in the past five years, to generate a single dollar of growth we have "spent" $18 , thirty percent from central banks. All this while maintaining the system's total consolidated debt at 440% of GDP. This 'investment' in growth that is supposed to be accomplished through astronomical deficits, debt and aggressive expansion of central banks simply does not bear fruit. Of course, many say that the solution is to continue doing it until it works. But the system becomes increasingly fragile and subject to massive shocks with the slightest movement of interest rates. These pedestrian growth levels also occur in the middle of a fierce financial repression period . Devaluations and interest rate cuts discourage savings, and push the system further into debt. Money is "cheap" and saving is considered "silly". But meanwhile taxes are raised and disposable income is destroyed. It impoverishes the population in four areas: savings, their profitability, real income and consumption capacity. This leads to a much weaker system, because the fixed costs, public spending, multiplies in cyclical economies, leaving very little room for manoeuvre in hard times . And then governments say it is a revenue problem, as if an administration can be handled waiting for the bubble to return. George Osborne, in the UK, said "a government that spends 720 billion pounds a year cannot be called a government or an administrator, it is unacceptable." Notice he did not say in a moment "it is a revenue problem", which is what we hear in Europe all the time. Revenues come with economic activity, and if we suppress it through taxation to finance an unacceptable expenditure, this economic activity will not improve. Think of Spain, which is showing signs of recovery. Debt to GDP has reached 92%, increasing by 17.16% over the same period of 2012 and above the full year target of 91.2%. However, the Spanish Treasury plans to save about 5 billion euros on cost of financing. Why? The cost of debt has dropped more than financing needs have grown. Phenomenal. The concerns about the European Union is gone, the European Central Bank helps, the economy is slowly coming out of recession ... All true. And the much needed reforms have stopped almost to a halt because debt is cheap. A bad incentive. However, the annual financing needs of the economy are at historic highs, around 70 billion euros. Imagine even if it as 30 billion if Spain reaches its ambitious 2015 goals. Even so, the country relies on an environment of extreme low rates not to suffer a debt shock. But imagine that the low yield party continues, and the Japanisation of European economies deepens. If we, as Japan, absorb the vast majority of our debt, we can achieve the effect of deceiving ourselves and lowering the cost artificially to unacceptable levels under normal conditions (such as the 0.7% of the Japanese ten year bond) Hurray! What will happen? That the perverse incentive to increase spending, not to reform the economy and make debt shoot up to 220% of GDP is too sweet not to be taken by the government. And then the problems become insurmountable, because European economies are not Japan in any sense, from labour to exports or industry. But, imagine that this debt accumulation "does not matter" because we're putting it in our pension plans, in our investment funds and it finances our airports, highways, hospitals, schools. It's the social contract, right? The only contract signed by the unborn to pay the privileges of the living. The problem is that such social contract sweeps away disposable income and savings in financial repression and taxes to finance public expenditure. In The EU it exceeds 40% of gross domestic product. The absolute costs go up because it is always deemed as "little", and the unit costs also soar because the population ages and fewer taxpayers contribute to that imaginary contract. So the economy stagnates. Debt grows. And one day, everything explodes. By then, economists will say that the solution is a devaluation or a debt-haircut, which is to impoverish the entire nation again, destroying the pension funds and savings. In the United States, reverend Emanuel Cleaver called the debt ceiling negotiations the "Satan sandwich" , because among the bread slices there is nothing. The reverend's error was to think that the country can afford eternally a deficit of almost 800 billion, despite stimulus, modest growth and some job creation. Spain's mistake would be to think it's time to relax adjustments because the economy has started to grow. An 0.6% growth of GDP with an increase of 6-7% in debt is simply unsustainable. Now that we see the light at the end of the tunnel it is precisely no time to stop the reforms. It is essential to address the expenses and pay extreme attention to this accumulation of debt, to avoid shocks when yield-seeking euphoria stops, because as we dedicate our efforts to justify every useless expenditure as "small" and debt as "manageable", the system becomes more fragile. And risk accumulation eventually bursts. By then ... governments will blame the markets.]] "Recovery begins from the darkest moment" John Major We have started to see signs of optimism in Europe supported by a macroeconomic environment that, far from being attractive, is showing some encouraging data. But the fragility of the recovery is still high. - Industrial production indices are approaching expansive levels. - Corporate margins are improving, quietly, thanks to exports and cost control. - Private debt has been reduced to 2006 levels. - Financing costs for small and medium enterprises, including Spain and Italy, have fallen to two-year lows. - Gas imports have increased for the first time since 2008, which is very relevant to industrial activity. (Courtesy Morgan Stanley, SocGen) All these elements themselves should not lead us to be overly optimistic, but neither should be ignored. Recovery is extremely weak since, at the same time, countries persist in tax rises and attacks on disposable income that depress consumption. And if we don't see an improvement of consumption, all other variables are simply smoke. Unemployment and consumption are the two great scourges of Europe. With all the government support and a highly interventionist state, unemployment in France has reached three million people. In Spain, above 6 million, it has dropped only by 31 people in August, a moderate slowdown in job losses. But job creation is only going to happen when consumption recovers, and that will not happen in an environment where disposable income is curtailed and taxes destroy families and SMEs. The fiscal burden in the European Union is already about 40%. Threatening to raise taxes on big business now is another huge mistake. They've been a pillar of internationalization and growth, and thanks to them we now have global multinationals, employing tens of thousands. But these strategic moves cost a great effort in debt and weak balance sheets.The cleaning of such balance sheets has not been completed in full, despite cost savings and divestitures, and to raise taxes is a dangerous move that creates more harm than good. Because these large corporations are also big employers, generate the bulk of private investment in the countries, and their social security contributions are one of the main guarantees of the financial sustainability of the welfare systems. Further tax changes would also delay the entry of foreign capital until conditions are stable and attractive. The European Union has warned France that it can not go higher in its tax burden, but this week we read that in 2014 there might be more tax increases. Spain is seeking to raise 25 billion more adding new taxes. Unfortunately, as always, these measures delay the recovery and do not generate the desired revenues. The tax increases are not helping consumer or employment, but also do not improve the borrowing countries. Keep in mind that at the end of 2013 the debt to GDP in the euro area might exceed the current 90.6% by at least 1%, and that the state deficits continues to rise above 4%. In this environment of low interest rates and moderate risk premiums, there seems to be little problem, but low interest rates and strong bond demand do not last forever. Europe, main beneficiary of fear of U.S. debt ceiling From the point of view of the credit market, there is little to worry about, because Europe is likely going to be a beneficiary of the fear that the US exceeds the debt ceiling in October. 16.4 trillion dollars in debt, the fourth time pass this limit since Obama arrived, despite the timid spending cuts and tax increases. A problem that is not going to find a simple solution like the last time, as Republicans will not accept further increases in taxes. But the relative calm in Europe can not mask the huge debt problem across the eurozone, and should be used to prepare a challenging winter. After the German elections, the pressure to accelerate reforms and reduce deficits will increase, no matter who wins. We saw it in the debate between Merkel and Steinbruck. None of them questioned austerity, but the pace of it. In fact, they accused each other of being too complacent with Greece. Thus, European countries, and peripherals in particular are going to have to face excessive deficit budgets, and three risks : - An Italian government crisis amid debt ratios that are much higher than expected.The financing needs of the public sector already reached 60 billion euro as of August 2013, almost double the figure of 2012. - A current account deficit in France of nearly 60 billion in 2013, and a debt to GDP that is on its way to 100% in a short period of time (currently 91.7%). - A deficit in Spain that, despite the recovery, is exceeding all targets. It was 4.38% in the central state, compared with year-end target of 3.8%. So why be optimistic? Since the problem can be short-term financing and that Germany and the paying countries will continue to press for the much needed structural reforms, it is likely that, as I have commented in CNBC a few times, the European Central Bank might conduct another liquidity injection (LTRO) to help the financial system to face the risk of higher interest rates and possible bumps in the huge portfolio of government debt that banks accumulate. Only in Spain, more than 213.6 billion. European banks accumulate up to 20% of Europe's sovereign debt and that weight is monitored constantly by the European Central Bank. But, like other liquidity injections, the problem will be generated if it is used to give another kick to the can and take this slight recovery as an opportunity to increase tax pressure and delay the reform of governments that spend between 10 and 50 billion more than they collect structurally. Because then we will find the same problem as in previous periods of slight improvements: the bureaucratic machine crushes the recovery. Olympics On Friday bets soared giving Madrid some chance to win the 2020 Olympics organization, above the favourite city, Tokyo. For Spain, the possibility of organizing the Olympic Games can be, as always a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the analysis of The Economic Journal ( The Olympic Effect , Andrew Rose and Mark Spiegel) estimates that trade improves 20% over the medium term. On the other hand, it has a cost and means a debt that will probably be very hard to add, even if most of the infrastructure is already built. But if most of it is built there ill be little impact on employment and growth. The Madrid bid is sold as a "low cost" one ith an estimated budget of 1.6 billion euro. Even if that figure is doubled, it's a small percentage of GDP and groth. We'll see. Of the countries that have hosted Olympic Games since 1976, exactly half generated a net profit, and the other half, either lost money or barely broke even. In the UK the cost fell at almost 9 billion pounds and generated a positive impact on the economy of more or less the same amount, about 8 billion, according to the BBC; 8.8 billion according to the Mayor of London. In any case, with or without Olympics, there are reasons to believe in the Spanish recovery, as I said in my article "Spain, Bottoming Out" , and we should not overlook the positive data in Europe, but growth will not return until disposable income improves. And if the tax burden is increased, it is not good news. ]] "However the Germans vote on 22 September, Berlin's attitude to the EU is not going to change much" - Charles Grant Two weeks ago, Angela Merkel and Peer Steinbruck , leading candidates for German Chancellor,  held an election debate on TV. It was a quiet event, without fanfare or big accusations. There were no negative comments to the policies of budget cuts, rather the opposite. Commenting this with German friends, they told me: "The obsession with the so-called austerity is a problem in other countries, here people understand that budgets must be balanced". Merkel ended the debate with a speech that included an interesting sentence: "It's been four good years ". Counting with a public account surplus, expected growth of 1.7% in 2014, and the lowest level of unemployment in decades, 6.8%, she was right. The elections, even with different combinations of coalition, will be, with high probability, a success for Merkel. And that's good. None of the major parties, even assuming a grand coalition, question the spirit of the policies that have been carried out in the past decade. Same as Germany's support to the European project, but there are important elements that have relevant implications for other countries. - The Banking Union: the model that is being sold in the peripheral countries seems like a kind of idyllic solution to a bloated banking system (320% of GDP in Europe) with significant capitalization problems, but in Germany this banking union is rightly considered 'debt monetization through the back door" and cannot be pushed forward while banks have still not carried out the necessary recapitalization processes, including the German ones. - Energy Policy: There has been a great controversy in Germany about the huge increase in electricity tariffs to consumers due to giant solar subsidies. After 100 billion euros in subsidies, final tariffs to consumers have risen by 50% between 2008 and 2013, with the green component (EEG) more than doubling. Merkel is already considering cuts to subsidies and there are strong concerns about the risk of social exclusion for citizens after cutting supply to 60,000 customers who could not pay the exorbitant bills. This can have serious implications on the energy policy of the European Union, directing it towards competitiveness instead of climate change targets. - Bailouts to other countries and deficit targets: a large part of the political debate has focused on the risk of another bailout package to support Greece and Der Spiegel criticized the government for giving figures of the German contribution to help troubled countries that were much lower than the real ones. It is difficult to see the government after the elections being more relaxed about bailouts and missing deficit targets. Germany has accepted huge cuts since the "2010 Plan" implemented by Schroder in 2003 with the goal of restoring competitiveness and economic stability, but Germans perceive that the other countries are not willing to take such measures and the benefits of the German policy is going to the rescued countries, that is why 57% oppose giving more money for bailouts. - European Central Bank : There is no major party that seeks to change the mandate of the central bank, and all seem against the possibility of a further cut in interest rates that could increase the excess of liquidity in the system and the perverse incentives for governments to continue avoiding reforms. The perception that after the elections we will see a relaxation in the German position on Europe is not evident in any of the political manifestos. Because the view in Germany is that there is no firmness, just total acceptance of countries that miss targets. Of course, as the European recovery is confirmed, with an estimated growth of 1.1% in 2014 (Eurozone), and all countries in positive growth territory in that year, even if it is modest, we will see less need for aggressive budget cuts and austerity measures. However, reforms are still needed, especially with countries that spend up to 20% more than they collect. The German model has been much more effective to get out of the crisis than the French proposals to spend its way out of recession. In 2013, France will generate an additional deficit of 4% of GDP, with unemployment topping 10.9%, while Germany generates surplus and lowest unemployment in decades. It's interesting, because Germany and France had similar deficits and debt levels only ten years ago. Germany took the path of reforms and France decided to "stand and wait". The big hurdle is job creation. Germany launched the mini-jobs program and achieved two objectives, switching low-productivity sector jobs into new ones, providing training from a work environment, and secondly reduce unemployment to 6.8%. It was a positive formula to relocate employees out of declining sectors into high productivity ones. Another obstacle to job creation is the excessive tax burden, close to 52%. In these elections Angela Merkel's proposal is to lower taxes after many years of budget adjustments. Germany is nothing without the rest of Europe, and vice versa. It is the second country after France for peripheral exports. This trade should continue to bring Europe out of recession and back into growth. The German commitment to support Europe will stand firm no matter who wins. But it will not be a blank cheque like that of 2008, which led the EU to spend 1.5% of GDP in stimulus to destroy four million and a half jobs. Germany experienced the mistake of those stimulus plans in 2008 and in June 2010 introduced the largest spending cut plan in sixty years, the Zukunftspaket (package of measures for the future) along with a medium-term financial plan (2010-2014), which included cuts to achieve a maximum 0.35% deficit. More than a third of those cuts occurred in the social security and public administration. Despite the crisis, the government deficit fell from 4.3% in 2010 to a surplus of 0.2% in 2012. And having met the objectives of 2014 more than two years early, finance minister Bertrand Benoit announced new cuts of 6.1 billion euros in July this year. The policy of keeping reforms is absolutely essential for a strong Europe, to avoid a collection of oversized governments in indebted and inefficient countries. The German elections, if Merkel wins, will provide continuity for the rest of Europe. And that's good. The recovery process cannot be achieved by adding debt and deficits all over. It has to be made surpassing individual goals ... This is how the European Union strengthens. The policy of fiscal prudence, wrongly called austerity, must continue. ]] Richard Fuld (ex-Lehman CEO) "The blame on the firm's share price collapse lies on hedge funds and short sellers" On September 15th 2008... ...

Zig Ziglar I have mentioned in interviews for a few months that indicators show that Spain is bottoming out and showing signs of improvement. Nobody can deny that in the past I have always doubted the so-called "green shoots", but this year the encouraging data accumulation is significant. It is worth noting two things: . Positive data begins to seem plausible for the investment community , wary of the eternal "we are improving" messages of our country that end up being mirages.The UBS report "Spain is getting better" is a relevant example. . We must avoid the risk of complacency. The fragility of the economy remains huge and, as we saw in the past, slowing don the pace of reforms and maintaining structural inefficiencies can lead the country to a standstill. Hitting the bottom and staying there is the biggest risk that I've been mentioning for months. The "Japanisation" of Spain and another lost decade. Unemployment data and expected GDP are two elements. Spain might leave recession this quarter with an 0.2% growth. That unemployment fell down to 26.26%, 225,000 less, is a positive. Even if we take the data with all the caution in the world and knowing that unemployment is still unacceptably high, it shows that the trend of stopping job destruction, which timidly began to show in April, is now evident. But there are other data that seem very relevant. The Purchasing Managers Index was 50 in June, which is the level at which the economy begins to approach the possibility of expansion. Bank deposits have also increased after years of decline, rising 0.46% to 1.48 billion euros in June. But the most important data-point for me is the strength of exports, both in volume and margin for companies, showing how a country can improve dramatically without falling into the easy trap of devaluation. Minister Luis de Guindos this week highlighted the importance of the long-term internal adjustment conducted by Spain. It is very important because, unlike the devaluation of the currency, it does not create a disproportionate increase in imports and inflation. A more durable and long-term positive effect. Spanish exports have reached a record high absolute and relative to Europe, but our current account balance has not deteriorated, in fact, it has improved massively to be in surplus. This improvement is not only due to the much needed decline in internal demand. Spain does not need more wasteful infrastructure spending. The improvement in exports and margins show a combination of entrepreneurial effort and commitment to value. Another important factor to note is that corporate debt has fallen to 2006 levels and that, following general declines in recent years, the country has started to see large multinational companies post better figures in Spain (IBM, L'Oreal, Carrefour). Where should we focus attention to trust this timid recovery? Consumption continues to fall. It is essential that the government understands that disposable income should improve, not through forced wage increases, which would lead to cost inflation, lack of competitiveness, unemployment and prolonging the recession, but cutting taxes. It is the only way to improve consumption and revive the economy. BBVA's report "Consumption Outlook First Half 2013" clearly shows that importance. Excessive debt and deficit. The fact that there is no pressure to reduce the deficit below 6.5% in 2013 and 5.8% in 2014 does not remove the risk that such amount of new debt creates, more than 130 billion euro. It involves an enormous drag on an economy here debt already exceeds 90% of GDP. Because the current environment of low interest rates, investor appetite and moderate risk premiums may change in a global economy. Administration reform and adjustments . The government emphasizes that the structural adjustment was 4 percentage points of GDP and 300,000 public jobs have been cut, but spending on public wages has not dropped significantly and the weight of public expenditure is still extremely high (almost 50% of GDP including public enterprises). Relaxing the reforms has an immediate negative effect on an economy as fragile as the Spanish. New issuance of debt ( 136 billion) and net requirements ( 76 billion) continues to be at record highs, almost four times higher than the 2005-2007 average. If Spain's rating is lowered, the castle could crumble. Non performing loans will continue to rise, probably to 13% due to the recognition process of refinanced loans, which continue to hinder the credit market, but the Spanish banking sector is no longer a danger of being a black box where no one knows what is hidden. It has carried out a process of transparency and capitalization unlike any other European countries. The energy reform has raised concerns among investors about the risk that the cuts are extended and perception of legal insecurity. The fact that Minister Soria has discussed with investors, and openly acknowledged the issues of cost and overcapacity in Spain is an important initiative that should be repeated often for the government to understand the concerns, opportunities, risks and consequences of its actions. Spain has made ??progress, but is far from healed, and has lost 10 positions in the ranking of countries with more economic freedom according to the Heritage Foundation primarily due to the tax increases. Now it needs further reform, lowering taxes and liberalization to recover those ten positions and as many more. In the market I perceive genuine interest to see Spain prove to be the first major success of the so-called "austerity" in Europe, which is not austerity but fiscal prudence. Spain is proof that the best solution to correct the excesses of massive infrastructure spend and real estate bubble is internal adjustment. Germany proved it with its "Agenda 2010" launched in 2003, which has helped unemployment fall down from 11 to 7.2%, get the social security system in surplus and the public accounts from a 4,8% deficit to an impressive 0.2% surplus. I sincerely hope Spain does not relax its commitments thinking it has done enough, and shows what everyone says in London. When Spain does well, it rocks. ]] You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.

William J H Boetcker's Ten Cannots]] Our country is headed toward a 'fiscal cliff.' The bad news: We elected a guy whose campaign slogan was 'Forward' - Jay Leno See my intervention on CNBC about the matter here: http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?play=1video=3000205718 and http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?play=1video=3000205434 and on the BBC here One of the perverse government incentives that we have always discussed in this column is the policy of kicking the can forward. Governments relax the objectives of debt and deficits, introduce monetary expansion measures, cut interest rates and what happens?.  They exceed all limits and debt grows faster. As a magic formula to resolve a balance sheet crisis it is simply not working. Government spends more, debt continues to soar and the citizen gets buried in taxes. Thank you for your money. Look at the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States. Financial repression has only encouraged more excessive borrowing. The mantra that is repeated again and again, "now is not the time", "we have to borrow more", "the important thing is to grow" simply does not work. It is not a matter of growth. As we commented two weeks ago, in the past five years, the G-7 'spent' $ 18 to generate $1 of GDP. As I expected throughout the negotiations of the fiscal cliff in late 2012, it was only a matter of time until the US exceeded the debt ceiling . Indeed, this might happen in October. The situation is so perverse that the government spending machine accelerated ahead of the deadline like the car in the final scene of Thelma and Louise. In less than four months in 2013, the Obama administration has added 300 billion debt to the system. That, after raising taxes and introducing budget cuts. And now, as the deadline approaches, President Obama has the audacity to declare that the government "will not allow to be blackmailed" . It is a superb tactic. First, full throttle spending, exceed all limits, despite the economy growing and tax revenues helping, and then ask for more spending. Like a child that says "if I don't get more sweets I will stop breathing". Amazingly, in 2006 Obama, then senator, voted against raising the debt ceiling. Seven trillion dollars of debt afterwards, he seems to see no problem in lifting it . It's worth watching this video from his 2008 campaign and what he said about raising the debt ceiling: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydZTHPkOnvE Since 2001, the debt ceiling in the United States has been 'raised' 13 times, which has led to an accumulation of additional debt of 10.4 trillion. The main mistakes we usually read about the US debt ceiling are: - The US is not going to default because they can print all the money they want. However, in 1979 it had to delay payments on debt maturities for 122 million, and the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011 culminated on August 5th with the loss of the country's debt top rating of 'AAA' by Standard Poor's. Of course, monetary expansion (Quantitative Easing , QE) keeps the appearance of normality, but to quote Richard Koo in his report "U.S. faces QE "trap", "the vicious circle of rising interest rates and economic weakness has already begun". "No country has injected so much liquidity and lived to tell". The 'magic bullet' trap of expanding the monetary base is simply impossible to stop without negative consequences, because the debt has soared and the economy does not improve. - Everything is just political posturing , the debt ceiling will be raised and all will continue normally. Since 1976 there have been seventeen shut-downs where the federal government can not carry out new spending. In 1995-96 the shut-down in the administration Clinton lasted 21 days. The Obama administration reached the debt ceiling in May 2013 following an unprecedented increase in spending from February to July. Give a cheque to the government and it will spends it, and more. In this occasion it has managed to keep within the 'limit' with "extraordinary measures", but on October 17th the limit simply is unavoidable. This time it will not be easy for Republicans to accept another deal that will probably lead to another fiscal cliff in May-June 2014. - It is an unjustified attack from Republicans. The Obama administration wants to spend $1.1 trillion in "discretionary" spending in 2014. Discretionary. The maximum allowed currently is just ten percent lower. Therefore, it is not a monstrous disaster that leaves families in the streets and the state without resources. It is simply a matter of budgetary restraint and to delay a social security plan, Obamacare , that is generating more doubt and concerns about the cost of its implementation than the existing Medicare system. - The cost of a 'government shut-down' is irrelevant. The 1995-1996 one is estimated at about 2 billion dollars of today. In 2014 it could mean 35 billion. The debt ceiling problem in the United States will not be the same now that interest rates are rising, the Fed has had to revise down their growth estimate for the economy and the risk of a new fiscal cliff in a few months looms again. Even if yields are low and demand is strong, a deficit of close to 800 billion and a debt of 101% of GDP do not improve with the economy growing just 2 to 2.2%. The U.S. must tackle immediately its spending spiral . All debt ceiling increases in the past have been accompanied by more and more deficit spending. Kicking the can forward has worked as interest rates fell. Now, the risk of ignoring the accumulation of debt and keep spending is too high, as is the case in the UK or Japan, the other kings of the money printing press.  Because there is only one way for interest rates to go. Up. The perverse incentive of "debt does not matter", matters in the end. A lot.]] "The most scary thing is that even the Central government does not really know how large the size of the local government debt is". - Hu Yifan I mention it constantly. Massive debt accumulation generates greater fragility in the financial system. While global PMIs maintain their expansionary phase, we start to feel a certain level of deceleration. Fitch reduced its global growth estimates for both 2013-to +2.3% - and 2014-from +3.1% to +2.9% -, and the more cyclical companies that have posted results are cautious about the outlook for 2014. We should note that some economies are moving dangerously towards stagnation. Brazil , damaged by the populist policies of Rousseff , with soaring inflation, is poised to post virtually no growth in 2015 and India, with a growing current account deficit and high inflation in food prices, is a concern that I have mentioned before in this column. However, in between investor euphoria, the liquidity trap of monetary stimulus created by the eternal QE and imbalances in emerging countries, we had forgotten China. It is worth analysing some data. China continues to grow in a planned and optically spectacular way (9.1% annualized in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2012). The machine is doing 'okay' as long as the Government keeps it well oiled. It is the triumph of massive debt and central planning. Triumph? No, it is not . Even prime minister Li Keqiang, according to Reuters, referred to Chinese GDP as "man-made and for reference only ". A model of high debt and central planning that Spain implemented with disastrous results in the decade of "debt does not matter". The Shibor (the Chinese interbank rate, similar to LIBOR) soared again last week, as it did in June. The interest rates in an excessively leveraged economy move back up again, despite past interventions of the People's Bank of China, putting at risk an economic system where the amount of non-performing loans and the true amount of provinces' debt are unknown. - Indeed, the Chinese provincial debt is not really known . Analysts' estimates move between $2.5 trillion and $5 trillion, between 30% and 60% of GDP. In the United States, for instance, it's less than 18%. This lack of transparency and information also shows how little control the central government has over the regions' debt . Maybe that's why it has approved the creation of regional bad banks, to try to reduce systemic risk. - The private credit bubble, according to Credit Suisse , is above 178% of GDP, 26% above the acceptable maximum. Total debt reached 200% of GDP. Remember Spain in 2007? It was close to 300%. And the level of spending-investment- is 12% higher than Japan at the height of its stimulus policy. Investment to GDP exceeds 48%, almost 10% more than the countries that industrialized more rapidly in the twentieth century. Of course, many people justify this level of investment by the need to modernize the country. However, in infrastructure, China suffers from overecapacity in many areas. It has the same highway density as the UK or the U.S.. - All this credit bubble would not be a problem if Chinese companies were making fabulous profits and margins were spectacular, which would make the debt easily payable. However, 48% of the Hang Seng Index (comprising the largest Chinese companies) generated returns below cost of capital in 2012 and almost 30% did not cover financial costs with free cash flow. Does that sound familiar to those who heard "debt does not matter because most is non-recourse" in peripheral Europe in 2007?. Net margins of Chinese companies are the lowest (2.5%) of all emerging countries (average 6%). - A real estate bubble uncomfortably similar to the Irish or Spanish. Real estate investment is 18.7% of GDP compared with Spain at the height of our bubble (22%) and Ireland (20%). The ghost towns that populate the Chinese geography are well known, but when growth has started to slow down, new housing construction has soared by again to keep the "growth by central mandate" plan, surpassing sales by 20%. - Aggressive borrowing process. Today China takes up to four times more debt than in 2010 to create one unit of GDP. So what's the problem? The arguments supporting or justifying the Chinese Model are: "You're a scaremonger, this has been the case since 2000." "While there is credit available and the government decides it, China will grow as much as needed, there is no problem." "As long as the non-performing loan risk is concentrated in its banks, there is no contagion to the rest of the world." "There is no bubble, only a moderation of growth." "As long as China grows above 5%, the rest of the world is fine." Surprise, it's the same we heard in 2007-2008 in Ireland or Spain. However, China has huge implications for global credit markets -as it's the second-largest buyer of U.S. treasury bonds-, and for the anaemic industrial recovery process on which Japan depends heavily to improve its exports. These data, as Goldman Sachs ,UBS and Credit Suisse point out in its excellent report "China: Curb Your Enthusiasm", show an uncomfortable reality. The Chinese government is faced with two alternatives: to grow artificially leading to a financial crisis of unpredictable effects, or clean its banks of systemic risk, which unquestionably means to limit credit expansion, and thus stopping its growth-through-debt model. Non-performing loans in China now exceed $88 billion. A figure that seems surprisingly low, as it is "officially" only 1% of total loans, compared with 9% in peripheral Europe or 12% in Spain, but the ratio is disguised by the huge amount of new loans, and the methodology to account as non-performing. But everyone, including the central government recognizes that the magnitude of the problem is worrying . An entrepreneur friend of mine, when asked if he was considering expanding to China said, "China is like the lottery, you can win, but most pay more than they receive." How long can the China bubble last? Years, or months. But today it's not a matter of 'scaremongering' or unwarranted concerns. The combination of low margins, massive debt and economic multipliers plummeting alarmingly always ends up badly. How badly it will end depends on the decision of the Chinese government. Moderate the madness or head towards a financial crisis. ]] Oil is flat and looking at a weak short term trend sliding between $105-110/bbl Brent. The short term palliative of a deal in Washington to temporarily address the debt ceiling and budget overcame the potential longer-term implications of reports of constructive dialogue between Iran and the global powers in Geneva which has the potential, given the US' positive reaction, to see sanctions eased. Clearly there is a long way to go to get to something substantive and Iranian exports will not recover quickly but fall in Iranian's exports has compensated for poor demand growth and strong US production growth. I still see the discount of WTI to Brent ($10/bbl currently) widening as supply in the US and inventories increase while tightness in Brent market remains, with Libya disruptions continuing. Libya's oil production is stable at around 600kbpd, where it has been for about a month. The Eagle Ford shale of South Texas has nosed ahead of the rival Bakken play of North Dakota in the race to produce 1 million barrels per day of oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The EIA's new monthly Drilling Productivity Report says total production from the Eagle Ford hit the 1 million-bpd milestone in August and expects output to rise to 1.07 million bpd in October, and to 1.09 million bpd in November, Reuters reported. Regarding US production of shale oil and gas, an EIA study was published that covers the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Niobrara, Permian, Marcellus and Haynesville tight oil/shale plays which it says covers over 90% of US tight oil/shale production and nearly all gas production (~3.7m b/d of oil and ~34,000 mcf/d). States new well production per rig (b/d) has increased yoy in all 6 regions for both oil and gas, with the exception of gas production in the Niobrara which is down and in the Permian which is flat. Most notable were the increases yoy in Bakken oil and Marcellus gas production/rig.  Conversely production from older wells is falling faster than it did a year ago for oil, though little change in the trends for gas, on average. Net net, the EIA estimates that oil production in November will rise (vs Oct) in all 6 regions, by ~60k b/d (+1.6%), primarily from the Bakken and Eagle Ford. The picture for gas is more mixed with the IEA predicting rises from the Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Bakken but falls from the Haynesville and Niobrara (Permian flat), leading to an overall rise of just over 1% m/m. US crude inventories have been building on strong domestic supply and the onset of refinery maintenance season.. This week EIA Crude stocks were +5.25 mboe vs. +4 mboe expected. Gasoline stocks -1.81 mboe vs. -2.57 mboe expected. Demand 18.269 Mboepd, yoy -4.5% . Crude oil production up +1,286 kboepd yoy. Reuters is suggesting Kashagan may not resume operations this month (ENI 17%, XOM 17%, RDS 17%, TOTAL 17%, KazMunaiGas 17%, COP 8%, INPEX 8%). 76kboped less supply. US Ga s also likely to keep the $3.80-4/mmbtu level. Inventories are now 3,577bcf, widening the surplus versus the 5-yr average to 57bcf. Since May, weather has been 1% cooler than the 5-yr average. Over the last month, the weather-adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been 0.7bcf/d oversupplied vs the 5-yr average. US natural gas producer hedging activity has slowed in the past quarter, but with $4/mmbtu, a greater portion of next years gas output is hedged than in the past three years. CO2 is in no man's land and likely to be rangebound for a while despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel support for EU plans to prop up carbon prices by temporarily removing some of the surplus allowances. "We need a degree of back-loading of CO2 emissions so that the certificate price can reach a reasonable level again," Merkel said. She said a rise in certificate prices would help modern, flexible gas-fired power stations which were now struggling to compete with coal-fired plants, which emit many more carbon emissions, because carbon permit prices were now so low. Coal has enjoyed a short term rally driven by stronger thermal coal demand in Japan (+24% ytd) but oversupply, high inventories and weakening India and China consumption are likely to keep it rangebound. Latest port data shows that India imported 9.1mt of thermal coal in September the lowest since last year. This is an 11.6% mom decline and 33.5% down YTD. Met coal imports rose 8% to 25.1mt. The outlook short term remains poor and traders comment that the rupee's weakness curbs Indian buying and an open arbitrage remains the key to China's appetite for seaborne coal, meaning neither is likely to bid thermal prices higher On the positive side, Japanese thermal coal demand remains strong +24% YTD as nuclear output still not improving. Despite Japanese data, inventories and oversupply still weigh in on price. Australian coal exports continue at a strong pace. At just under 8.2mt, they are up from the 7.6mt YTD average, with both met and thermal coal shipments up WoW.  The World Steel Association released global steel and pig iron production data for September earlier this week. Global production reached an annualised rate of 1,613mtpa, up 7% YoY, but the real story was the return to growth of ex-China steel production for the first time since May 2012. Morgan Stanley mentioning safety regulation in China could put a floor on coal despite oversupply. Both Central and Shanxi local governments issued new policy papers on enhancing mine safety standards. a) State Council aims to shut down at least 2,000 mines by the end of 2015, targeting coal mines of  less than 90 thousand mt b) The government will stop approvals for new coal mines with annual capacity of less than 300 thousand mt c) Shanxi government is ordering a halt to all new mine construction projects and plans to conduct safety checks. The halt came after a mine accident at Shanxi Coking Group on Sept 28. MS estimate this will reduce Shanxis new capacity additions by 40-80mt from the initial expectation of 100mt for this year. UK Gas looks to remain strong and trading above the resistance of 69p/therm as volumes from Norway pick up. No unplanned LNG cargoes diverted to UK this week as demand from Asia continues to absorb most supply of LNG. . Inventories fall further below the 5 year average but companies maintain there is still enough to supply the winter demand. With storage levels in the UK trending near five-year lows (4,539 mcm), the likelihood of a spike is quite relevant as we enter maintenance season in Norway. Power prices in Europe will probably remain weak, with German power down as thermal output continues to disappoint with wind and solar taking up to 39% of all generation and capacity cuts mentioned by RWE more a long-term fix than a reality that could help prices. German power demand in August declined -1.9% y/y on working day adjusted basis (-2.6% unadjusted) according to BDEW data, despite August industrial production being up 0.3% y/y. Demand is also down for the first 8 months 2013, by -1.2% y/y. Brokers mentioning the possibility of stabilizing the German power market through capacity closures. The industry has so far announced 7 GW or 5% of thermal capacity closures over the next 5 years. UBS estimate that this would need to increase 7x to 50 GW to stabilise profits at the 2012 level. Nordpool is sliding back to parity with German power prices, with demand weaker, weather improving and hydro generation picking up, its likely to continue to slide unless winter kicks in colder than expected. ]] Remember Lou Reed.

I have been talking all month about the widening driven by tightness in Brent and ample supplies in US. Brent has stayed strong this week on the drying up of Libyan exports. No such supply issues in the US where crude stocks have risen well above the 5-yr range causing the Brent-WTI spread to widen abruptly. EIA this week: Crude stocks +4.09 mboe vs. +2 mboe expected. Gasoline stocks -1.71 mboe vs. +0.03 mboe expected. Demand 20.14 Mboepd, year-on-year +9.9% . US Crude oil production up +1,184 kboepd year-on-year. Peak what?. Coal slump continues, now at $82.00/mt, losing all its October gains as ample increase of exports from Australia and South Africa meet high inventory levels all over Europe and milder weather. We would not see switch from gas to coal at a meaningful level until coal reaches $81/mt according to Morgan Stanley. US gas continues to slide at $3.64/mmbtu. Weekly storage rose 38bcf, well below the 5-yr average of a 57bcf injection. Inventories are now 3,779 Bcf, narrowing the surplus versus the 5-yr average to 57bcf. Last weeks weather was 34% cooler than the 5-year average. Over the last month, the weather-adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been 0.4bcf/d oversupplied versus the 5-yr average. A drop below $3.50/mmbtu would prompt increased consumption in the power generation sector. Gas-fired generation becomes increasingly competitive with coal-fired power plants as gas prices drop, and as much as 1.5-2 Bcf/d of natural gas consumption can be lost and gained in the power generation sector as prices swing in the $3.25 to $4.25 /mmbtu range (according to UBS). UK gas is the only rock star commodity... Back at 69.70p/therm, above the resistance level of 69.50/th seen all month. Daily demand increased to 193 mcm from average month daily demand figure of 175 mcm. Despite acceptable storage levels, 4,600 mcm, prices have shot with demand increase. CO2 continues to collapse at 4.63/mt despite on-going talks and meetings expected in November at EU level to discuss strict measures to curb EUA oversupply. The debate in Brussels has already moved on from backloading to structural reform proposals, which could eventually lead to tightened system. Commission officials are increasingly sold on the idea of a flexible reserve mechanism, aimed at making the ETS a more responsive system so that a large over or under supply could not build up in future. Officials seem convinced that such reform should take effect in Phase III (2013-2020) though nothing will likely be agreed before 2015 and how this could work in practice is unclear. Don't bet on the EU to make a big change, and CO2 price reflects it. Power prices in Germany fall (again) to 37.35/MWh and Nordpool to 38/MWh. No real bullish argument either from weather or industrial demand anywhere in Europe except the UK where reserve margins remain tight (clean dark spreads at 26.5/MWh vs 24/MWh in September). In Southern Europe, demand continues to be weak. Power demand in Spain in October was down another 1.2% weather adjusted, with gas demand down 10.6%.]] Relying on ever-rising house prices pushing home values up via artificially cheap lending creates only the illusion of growth - Ros Altmann As you know, I have lived in London for ten years. The United Kingdom, throughout the Gordon Brown years, was the Keynesian stimulus experiment that the advocates inflation and devaluation always 'forget'. They talk a lot about Abenomics and Obama but forget the stimulus+inflation-led economic destruction of the early 2000s, and the hole in public finances it caused. A hole that the UK has not been able to dig itself out of, despite carrying out a brutal monetary stimulus policy where the Bank of England buys nearly 70% of the public debt issued. However, to the surprise of many experts, the United Kingdom appears to be starting to recover quickly. It is estimated that the economy grew by 1.5% in the first nine months, with a marked acceleration from quarter to quarter, to 3.2% annualized, and that will continue to advance by 3% in 2014. Given that in 2012 the economy grew by only 0.2%, the results are spectacular to say the least, especially considering that other members of the 'Money Printing Club' - Japan and the United States - continue to disappoint with very questionable macroeconomic results, from a massive trade deficit and debt in Japan, to lacklustre growth and weak labour market, according to the Federal Reserve itself, in the U.S.. What is the miracle of the British economy? Probably a housing bubble of dangerous proportions, already warned by newspapers as ideologically diverse as the Daily Telegraph , The Guardian and City Am (" Subprime Britain", read an article). There are unquestionable positive elements: - The UK now exports more outside the European Union (52%) than inside, being less exposed to the crisis in the Eurozone. Having reached a record high in June 2013, and growing at 3% annually, exports are about 32% of GDP. - Car sales have soared and have almost returned to pre-crisis levels, while in the European Union these remain at depressed levels. The exchange rate pound-euro favours European car sales in the UK. - After the recent tax cuts and support for small and medium enterprises, the level of unemployment reached its lowest levels since 2009, 7.7%, despite increased immigration. In addition, consumption began to grow, with data from Coffer Peach showing sales increases in restaurants (+1.9% in August) and hotels (+4% in the first half of the year). - Government deficit starts to decrease significantly. Cutting taxes, attracting capital and laying the red carpet for entrepreneurs works. And has generated record tax revenues ("tax receipts hit record high of 1bn per week more than Labour grabbed" read the Daily Telegraph). 25 billion pounds more in revenues, according to HMRC. See below the graph of the UK government deficit (-10% to -5.8%). - However, all this data is positive but not comparable to the impact of the Help to Buy policy, also known in the UK as the 'Viagra of the housing bubble'. The effects were very fast. Home prices have surpassed the 2008 peak, and they had already risen significantly with the entry of foreign money coming out of the EU looking for a safehaven against the risk of the euro break-up. This saw up to 80% of the houses sold in some areas going to Greek, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian investors in 2011-2012, according Foxton's. Companies like Grafton, a construction material supplier, have seen their sales in the UK rise by 5.5%. Cemex commented that sales in the country grew by 9% in the second quarter. The demand for housing, according to Crest Nicholson, was up 46% since the implementation of the Help To Buy.... And the average salary of construction workers rose 20% in the first half of 2013. See the index of house prices from Nationwide: Is this all positive? Demand grows, the economy grows, house prices recover, people see 'perceived wealth' increase, more furniture and curtains are sold... But there are several warning signs: - The guarantee of cheap money from the Government increases the risk of bad payments. There have been 210 billion pounds in aid available in the Funding for Lending and Help To Buy programs, while the ratio of debt to income soared for first-time buyers from 3 to 1 to 4.4 to 1 (The Daily Telegraph). - Most home sales -over 50% - are made ??without mortgage and sold to foreign investors looking to rent. But there is a lot of leverage hidden in these "yield-seeking" operations. Sometimes up to 75%. Maybe not mortgages, but loads of corporate debt. And in some cases, rental yields are as low as 2-3% (in Central London, for example). At the same time, rents have increased much faster than wages for five consecutive years, leading to an increased risk of default or exclusion, where, even if there is housing availability, conditions for rental are simply unaffordable. - In London the housing bubble seems well supported by two factors: the City and the arrival of foreign millionaires of any country. As a friend of a real estate agency says, "there is always a country that is doing well, and those people go to London as a first option." This is why London has become the most expensive city in the world, surpassing Tokyo. But that 'bubble expansive wave' is dissipated as one moves out of the M-25 (the ring road around London), which creates the risk of 'bubble implosion' as we saw in 2008. Prices soar starting in London and the shock waves reach up North, and when the bubble implodes, it impacts down to the South. Of course, the Bank of England is "carefully monitoring the risk of the creation of a possible bubble." It does not see danger today because transactions and mortgages signed are well below the highs of 2008, and because a large part is sold without any type of mortgage (but a lot of corporate debt). But that is where the risk lies... When those funds that buy real estate thinking of high rental yields find that there is an excess of unsold homes, which is never recognized as you all remember, corporate debt defaults start to rise. At the same time, the possibility of selling those houses becomes difficult because wages don't increase and the capacity of the majority of population to acquire just gets worse ... That is when the market sees the hidden stock of homes. The argument that the UK needs to build even more houses to cope with demand and help lower prices doesn't stack up. Building is a pro-cyclical business. And demand cannot rise eternally with wages and disposable income falling or stale. Perhaps this time the house price rise is more sustainable growth, as some argue, as it is less aggressive in debt. I would be cautious. This time we are substituting mortgage risk for corporate debt risk. Economic growth supported by a disproportionate increase in the price of houses and thinking that these can only go higher because "we need to build much more to meet future demand," explodes aggressively on almost all occasions. This time, moreover, the risk is in the balance sheet of the government that guarantees the Help To Buy, and therefore, if it goes wrong, you will pay it in tax hikes. We have to keep an eye on this risk. But above all, a message to countries that do not attract hedge fund managers, Russian millionaires or Rock stars: Please do not copy the formula. ]] Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something Necessary and imperative - Nassim Taleb I do not understand Bitcoin, but I do not understand women either and I am married - U.S. trader During the intense weeks promoting my book Journey to Economic Freedom I've been asked several times about my opinion on Bitcoin , the so-called "virtual currency" that has increased in price more than 100 times in eleven months. My opinion is simple. Bitcoin is not a reality, it's an expectation , and therefore its price evolution depends on it getting deployed globally and clarifying doubts about its role as a method of payment and 'storage of value'. Bitcoin is a startup currency. Its initial appeal is undeniable. A method of payment where states can not interfere in the money supply, and where investors can find a safe haven from the assault on the saver that is the increased financial repression imposed by governments and central banks. Sure, but my doubts come when the haven is virtual , and therefore always subject to hacker attacks. In addition, there's the risk of a confiscatory reaction from states if it reaches a 'dangerously high "implementation. 'Free' currencies tend to end up being abolished or confiscated. For now, Bitcoin is not a currency, it is an exchange network. Like a financial asset, a future or a derivative. Unlike legal tender currencies, no one is forced to accept it as a method of payment. It is not dissimilar to a barter coupon. You accept it as payment for goods and services just the same way as you use something  that is perceived as valuable by both parties, buyer and seller, be it a watch, a car or Bitcoin. As such, its value ??comes from the generalized perception of scarcity, future demand, liquidity and quality as a means to exchanging it for another currency, goods or services in the future. As a 'storage of value' asset it has some similarities with a gold ETF , but it is massively more volatile... and virtual. Therefore it is subject to extreme changes of perception with a supply and potential demand that is difficult to estimate. However, it has no real similarity with physical gold , having no history of transactions in times of extreme crisis. Everyone knows that gold can be exchanged for goods and services in case of a global catastrophe. Nobody knows yet how you create virtual storage of value. To be a currency, Bitcoin must go a long way in implementation, and be accepted globally for large and meaningful commercial transactions. Is Bitcoin a speculative bubble? A pyramid scheme, a Ponzi scheme? I finally received a good report with a detailed analysis approach ('Bitcoin, A First Assessment' by Bank of America Merrill Lynch ) that seeks to clarify the risks and opportunities of this virtual phenomenon. According to Merrill Lynch, assuming Bitcoin becomes a widespread means of payment for transfers and e-commerce, an approach to its valuation could be reached through the addition of: - The average capitalization of established means of payment such as Western Union, MoneyGram and Euronet, c$4.5 billion . - The expectation that Bitcoin could capture 10% of global e-commerce, and the U.S. investment bank estimates this at $ 5 billion . That is, around $9.5 billion capitalization, ie, below the market level, which stands above $13 billion. The first part of the valuation analysis seems appropriate in a conservative scenario, but some could say that Bitcoin, having the benefit of a restricted supply, should capitalize above Western Union. But it is the second part of the sum which is more complex to analyse. To reach $5 billion, Merrill Lynch assumes that Bitcoin would accumulate 10% of on-line residential sales in the U.S., and extrapolates it to the rest of the world. In the U.S. the total e-commerce market is $224 billion and the domestic sector (households) accounts for approximately $10 billion, of which 10% would potentially be absorbed by Bitcoin. If we assume that the U.S. is close to 20% of global GDP and a similar degree of penetration of both trade and on-line commerce of Bitcoin in the world, Merrill's analysts arrive at the figure of $5 billion capitalization. However, according to my own analysis, that number could be much higher if we include companies using Bitcoin aggressively. If we add companies with 10% implementation, this part could reach $50 billion capitalization, assuming other electronic payment penetration levels. Such an assessment would indicate that Bitcoin is either nearly 30% above its fundamental value, or up to 420% undervalued , depending on the penetration assumptions. That is the dilemma of analysing Bitcoin, to understand the ability to penetrate markets that today are huge and where a space can be generated for this method of payment without falling into the risks of: - Being a threat to states and their control over currency and the money supply. In a world where central banks and governments have made financial repression as a last resort to support excessive debt spending, the use of legislation to attack any means that threatens their main weapon of economic policy should not be underestimated. Bitcoin, even in the middle of the valuation range, would be far from becoming a 'problem' like that. - Confiscation of assets Roosevelt-style as we have seen in the past with gold, and other paradigms of government actions to steal the savings of investors in 'safe havens'. Being a virtual asset makes this very difficult, but not impossible. For Bitcoin to be a bubble, global electronic commerce estimates should be much lower than the current maximum capitalization, ie the perception of demand unachievable in a fairly conservative analysis. That risk is not there looking at sales trends of global on-line commerce. In addition, to be a bubble, Bitcoin should meet the requirement of having a rapid and increasing supply well above demand. Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million by 2140. To be a Ponzi scheme it should meet the following criteria: - That profitability granted to existing holders of Bitcoin is 'guaranteed' and coming from the additional coins purchased by new investors, ie, to make the basis of 'new investors' only growing. That is not the case, the valuation of Bitcoin it fixed by demand and supply generated by a multitude of buyers and sellers, and sellers have no false guarantee or allegedly safe "return". - That price dynamics is uniform, opaque, controlled by a single operator and providing a false sense of 'security', ie it only goes 'up' until new buyers stop falling in the pyramid scheme and it explodes. Bitcoin buyers are aware of the volatility and possibility of selling at a loss. Bitcoin has seen huge rises in price and massive  falls, it behaves more like a financial start-up, an asset where price is being checked every day according to the potential supply and demand. Therefore, it is not like a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin, for valuation purposes, is equivalent to a tech startup or a junior explorer-miner. Its value only transpires when it begins to dispel doubts about its implementation as a combination of means of payment and safe haven. To achieve the potential and penetration needed to justify much higher prices, there are two things to look for: - The enormous volatility, with moves of 30-40% in one day, makes it difficult for large companies and massive consumers to accept it quickly. Volatility itself prevents its penetration into the mass market. To be a universally accepted means of payment it should have similar levels of volatility to those established currencies or gold. That's why I say it's still not a currency, but a volatile financial asset . - The length and quality of exchange. Bitcoin has a major advantage, supply is limited, and to avoid manipulation by a bank or state, there is no centralized validation system (clearing) that is why each transaction is analysed and delayed, to avoid double counting. Well, for large transactions this means a wait of up to fifty minutes until a payment is confirmed, which greatly limits the mass deployment in companies and trade. Furthermore, several of the servers have been 'hacked'. One such exchange, Bitcoinica lost 18,547 bitcoins after a cyber attack. BIPS in Europe lost 1,195 after a security issue. When transactions are immediate, safe and not subject to huge volatility, valuation of Bitcoin could start to make sense. There are still many doubts to clarify. If you find it difficult to understand the phenomenon, it is best to avoid it, not ride a wave dependent on variables with huge fluctuations. I don't own any Bitcoin. I always thought that if something has a gazillion percent of upside potential, I may let the first massive rise to those that accept the risk that goes from 'experiment' to 'reality'. What I find interesting is that Bitcoin shows that more people are scared and looking for ways to get out of the vicious circle of financial repression and devaluation of currencies. The implementation of an 'intervention-free currency' or means of payment can only be positive. And, if Bitcoin or any other free currency ends up being widely used, it may restore sanity to those governments that engage in this race of currency destruction they want to sell us as 'social' and that in reality is just a massive transfer of wealth from savers to the indebted states. ]] Brent - WTI differential shrunk recently from $20 to $11.5/bbl. WTI rallied due to the Keystone line fill. Before the pipeline goes into service it needs to be filled up with oil (600kbpd) so there is a continuous flow once it starts up. The pipeline is 485 miles long and goes from Cushing, OK to Nederland, TX. Careful, this is a technical and temporary effect. Meanwhile Brent lost some strength on prospects of rising Libyan crude supply as exports are being restored. An agreement was reached this week between the leaders of tribes disrupting eastern ports' operations and the government, which could allow exports from the currently closed ports, including Brega, Es-Sider, Marsa al-Hariga Zueitina, combined capacity 600,000b/d, to resume on Sunday. The IEA adjusted upwards 2013 and 2014 oil demand estimates on the back of stronger than expected actual data for Europe and the US. 2013 demand forecast now 91.2m b/d, 2014 92.4m b/d. IEA also adjusted up the non-OPEC supply estimates. Overall neutral to the oil price. The market remains very well supplied (as I noted here ). In terms of supply, the agency noted that one should not expect a rebound in Iranian exports with the current provisional agreement (capped at 1 mb/d), and that the development of production requires several investments which will take time to take shape. For the time being, despite the situation in Libya, the market remains well supplied given that the production increase in non-OPEC countries; the call on OPEC in 2014 has remained stable at 29.3 mb/d. Non-OPEC surges to 56.2mmb/d in November. Non-OPEC production surged 470kb/d MoM to 56.2mmb/d in November, and up 1.9mmb/d YoY. FY13 non-OPEC production is on track for the largest YoY gain in percentage terms since 2002 at +2.6%. The IEA kept its forecast for non-OPEC production essentially unchanged for 2014 at 56.5mmb/d, up 1.7mmb/d YoY (+3.1%). All in all, the system has excess oil supply of 0.4mmb/d for 2013, and expected c 0.7mmb/d for 2014. Mexico passed its energy reform bill yesterday opening up its oil industry to outside investment for the first time in 75 years. Companies will be offered production sharing contracts, which could result in a resurgence in Mexican oil production, but it will take several years and tens of billions to happen. Mexico's crude production has declined to c2.5mmbpd from 3.5mmbpd in the past years due to poor investment. I bet Mexico doesn't return to 3.5mmbpd quickly in the next years. Coal rose to $84.5/mt on renewed concerns of high increase in vessel freight rates for coal in 2014, driving traders to add to stocks. Australian exports still offset winter demand growth. However, according to the WSJ, global coal consumption could grow as little as 2% a year through 2017 in the face of weakening Chinese demand, mentioning the International Energy Agency's most recent coal-market report. Long-term estimates for Chinese coal demand, for the year 2035, range from 3.66 billion tons of coal equivalent, up from 2.29 billion tons in 2010, to as low as 1.51 billion tons, depending on Beijing's environmental policies. IEA medium term coal market report: . Coal demand is to grow at 2.3% CAGR over 2013-18 vs 2.7% previously assessed and 3.4% over 2007-2012. . China is to account for 60% of new global demand, without reaching its peak within the next 5 years. . India will rival China as the top importer in the next 5 years. . Despite the slightly slower pace of growth, however, coal will meet more of the increase in global primary energy than oil or gas. CO2 at 4.9/mt stays weak after the market discounted the EU backloading vote, which addresses little of the oversupply of EUAs. The EU Parliament voted through the approval for the backloading of 900m tn of CO2 permits.  Backloading anyway doesnt address the structural oversupply that exists in the ETS of more than 2b tn. Following that another vote is due by the EU Ministers next week (December 16th) and then the Environment Committee will have to go over the details with another vote at the EU Parliament for final approval due next year. The EU is aiming for March/April finalisation. US gas has strengthened to $4.25/mmbtu after three consecutive weeks of tightening inventories, reducing the gas glut. Storage this week fell 81bcf, bullish versus the 5-year average of a 64bcf withdrawal. Since September, weather has been 2% colder than the 5-year average. Over the last month, the weather adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been just 2.6bcf/d less than the 5-year average. Producer discipline is being evident, although not as one would expect. This week lower 48 States production fell just 0.8% (0.58 bcf/d). Louisiana had the largest volumetric decrease at 5.3% (0.34bcf/d) due to maintenance normal well decline. Wyoming dropped 5.9% (0.33bcf/d) primarily because of a gas plant being shut down for most of the month. Gulf of Mexico production rose 6% (0.2 bcf/d) having completed platform and pipeline maintenance performed last month. Production, however, keeps rising year-on-year. UK gas remains rangebound at 70.15p/therm (-0.07%), and I expect it to remain rangebound as inventories stay unchanged and weather is milder. Storage remains at 4,394mcm and volumes from Norway into Langeled pick up 3.8% this week. Power prices drop throughout the EU as industrial production disappoints again. Eurozone Industrial Production in October was -1.1% vs expectations of +0.3% (Prev. -0.5%, Rev. -0.2%). Here are the scary figures of power demand in Europe: We had Italian power demand data this week and it came much worse than expected (-2% in November, -3.5% yoy), driven by poor industrial demand. Thermal production was down 2.4% in November and 13% year to date due to increased geothermal, wind and solar production and to offset the lower demand. Solar production increased by 16.9% (ytd +18.5%), wind was up 15.7% (ytd +19.5%) and geothermal +10.2% (ytd +1.5%). Pool prices in Spain have risen almost 9% recently on lower hydro. The National Commission for Competition and Markets (CNMC) have opened an investigation into possible manipulation of the electricity pool prices, with the pool having seen a significant rise in prices in recent days, just ahead of the Cesur auction via which the energy component of the tariff is set. High prices in the electricity pool paralyse 21 electricity intensive factories, with the Association of Large Electricity Consumes talking of industrial alarm. ]] Government outlays undermine actual savings. The larger the outlays are, the more actual savings are diverted from wealth generators - Frank Shostak The economic news of the week in Europe have reduced the euphoria about a possible recovery. France went into recession in the third quarter and general Eurozone data is weaker than expected. In my new book Journey to Economic Freedom (Deusto) I devoted a chapter to the mistakes in economic policies of many countries in the European Union, because they were copied from France. Stagnation, high taxation and lack of reforms.  In order to maintain at all costs a hypertrophied state and bloated administrations, funds are spent on useless schemes at the expense of those  who generate wealth. At the smallest hint of a recovery we see that countries, instead of continuing with reforms, decide to relax and fall back into recession. And now governments are worried about...deflation. Why? Let's see... Risk for peripherals The risk to the recovery of Spain and peripheral Europe could come from an impact on exports. Spain exported to the larger economies of Europe 50% of its goods. In the first half of 2013, an increase of 8% of exports in Spain, although sales to France fell 1.7% to Germany 0.6% and Italy 0.4%. Seems some peripherals depend less on the EU partners to export. Foreign investment in Spain between January and June 2013 also shows an important differentiator component on the past. Foreign investment of residents (ie, Spaniards bringing outside money) is only 4.9% of the total, so 95.1% comes from foreign investors . However, in the interviews I've had this week the question that was repeated again and again was that the greatest concern regarding the stagnation of the EU is the "risk of deflation." First we must clarify that in most European countries and in Spain there is no deflation, there is disinflation due to badly managed industrial plans and overcapacity . When you have invested (spent) hundreds of billions of euros in "industrial plans" and productive capacity, especially in energy, car industry, textile, retail and infrastructure, what we are experiencing is a reduction of prices due to competition between oversized sectors, an overcapacity of up to 40% in some cases. On the other hand, inflation exists in other elements, very relevant to the industry and consumption, such as energy costs. The "alleged risk of deflation" is the excuse of governments to justify greater financial repression . Trying to create false inflation through rate cuts while citizens have less purchasing power, or through monetary stimulus plans when taxes rise leads nowhere. Look at Japan, 17 consecutive months of real wage reductions. Prices fall because we built massive productive capacity for a demand that never arrived and because the disposable income of citizens has been destroyed by confiscatory taxation. To reactivate the economy governments should return money to the pockets of citizens who have stoically accepted and paid interventionist policies and supported schemes and incentives that have led the EU to spend up to 3% of GDP to destroy 4.5 million jobs and sink the economy. The economy is still not recovering in Europe, the transmission belt for monetary policy is broken, debt, both in relative and absolute terms, continues to grow, employment is not improving and now they tell us that we enter into deflation. First, credit to the private sector still has not improved because all available credit is crowded out by government debt, making the financial system more risky and therefore more fragile against any sovereign risk. Wages are still falling, and to think that forcing Germany to stimulate its domestic demand will have a ripple effect on the periphery is wrong empirically, as we mentioned in this column some months ago, where we showed that the multiplier effect of attracting foreign capital and direct financial investment is three times higher than internal domestic demand stimulus. This disinflation, the European Japanisation of which I already warned in 2012 is a dire consequence of interventionist policies, which lead to de-industrialization and demand collapse. Combating possible deflation risk with more interventionist policies while still curtailing the consumption capacity of citizens with higher taxes only leads us to enlarge the debt hole. In addition, the voices calling for monetary stimulus forget that the velocity of money, which measures economic activity, collapses, creating a transfer of money to financial assets, stocks and bonds, but the collapse of productive investment. According to Citigroup , the velocity of money in the United States  and United Kingdom has fallen to levels of the mid-60s while nominal GDP is at 2001 levels. But the stock market is at historic highs and high risk bonds, at minimum yields. That is, we create 'wealth illusion' in financial risk assets while sustaining GDP artificially, but destroy wealth creation and employment . We have to stop the vicious circle of spending, debt, impoverishment, financial repression, less wealth, less investment, higher unemployment and more spending and pass into a virtuous cycle of saving, budgetary restraint, improved disposable income, consumption , investment and employment. Prosperity does not come from unicorn breeding, but consumption and productive investment.]] 1) "Winter Symphony" (Brian Wilson, "Christmas Album" (Extended Edition) by The Beach Boys). Brian Wilson was going through a rough period in the mid 70s, locked in his home, not daring to leave, battling the demons of drugs, mental illness and an abusive environment. However, in the 70s he sporadically wrote gems like this evocative Christmas song, particularly coming from a person who has never lived outside of California. This song remained unpublished and only available on bootlegs for many years. For me one of Brian Wilson's masterpieces. We love you, Brian! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0BVypgYrxo "Somewhere children outside, Screamin' down a daredevil slide, Rosy-cheeked bundles of cold-weather clothes." 2) "Do They Know It's Christmas" (Band Aid single ) Bob Geldof ( Boomtown Rats ) and Midge Ure ( Ultravox ) composed one of the few Christmas songs that does not fall into empty cliches, and one of the catchiest choruses in pop history. Although the artists involved have done more damage to the ozone layer with their hairspray excess than the entire coal industry, this song is just perfect. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE "And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas / The greatest gift they'll get this year is life." 3) "Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)" (The Ramones, single ) The Ramones were not at their best artistic moment when they released this single, but they made ??a hymn to reconciliation and forgiveness, with a catchy melody that reminded us of their three first great and essential albums. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y5GtaTrPHM "I loved you from the start/ 'cause Christmas is not the time for breaking each other's hearts." 4) "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" (John Lennon, single ) + "Once Upon A Long Ago" (Paul McCartney, All The Best! ) The Beatles, together and separately, made ??several Christmas songs. Together, "Christmas Time Is Here Again", is not among their best. It is a simple and fun song, but nothing else. George Harrison made ??the terrible "Ding Dong Ding Dong" and Ringo Starr recorded several pop carols with mixed results ("I Wanna Be Santa Claus" being the best). But it was John Lennon with "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" the one that recorded the best Beatles' Christmas song. Paul McCartney made ??many, with Wings and solo (which comes to being the same thing). My favourite is not his biggest holiday hit "Wonderful Christmastime", but the darker and more pessimistic "Once Upon A Long Ago". http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Vfp48laS8 "So this is Xmas, And what have you done, Another year over and a new one just begun." http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBsSUptatMw "Playing guitars on an empty stage, counting the bars of an iron cage, Tell me darling, what can it mean? Once upon a long ago, children searched for treasure." 5) 'Winter Wonderland "(Darlene Love, Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You") Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You" is the best pop Christmas album in history, no doubt for me. A genius at the top of his game. He might have been a tyrant and a murderer, but he was an amazing producer and composer. As any good dictator, he gathered in a single album all the bands and artists he worked with, and note after note, instrument after instrument, created an album that is still as exciting today as it must have been in its day. A friend gave it to me as a present and I thought "how tacky, an album of Christmas carols by 60s pop stars". How wrong I was. I appreciate it now as one of the best musical gifts ever. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAC3jp8Z5c4 "In the meadow we can build a snowman / Then pretend that he is Parson Brown / He'll say, "Are you married?" we'll say "No man, But you can do the job when you're in town!". 6) "Mistress for Christmas" (AC/DC "Razor's Edge") If you don't like AC/DC you will hate this song. Loud. Sexist. Politically incorrect. But if you do not like AC/DC you are the enemy, LOL. This song was recorded during their weakest artistic period, but concentrates all the best of the group. A killer riff murderer, a rowdy and politically incorrect lyric and a thundering beat. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOBUUhsRwc "I like female form in minimum dress, Money to spend with a capital "S", Get a date with the woman in red" 7) "Santa's Got An Airplane" (Beach Boys "Christmas Album, Christmas '77 and extended edition") When Brian Wilson, composer of all their hits, fell into depression and mental illness, the Beach Boys disappeared from the music world as a relevant act. During the mid 70's, Mike Love came up with the bright idea of recycling part of their flop disastrous albums, Landlocked, which was rejected by the record company, and MIU, best forgotten as it contains the worst songs in the band's history, and change the lyrics to Christmas songs. Unfortunately this 1977 Christmas album was also rejected and was not published until many years later. From this record you can save this wonderful song, combining crazy hippy messages, drug references and nods to Christmas. Essential. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aHGvdamu1I "He skydives down to the chimney with Ease / Parachutes a package to the whole family / It's Santa's Air Special delivery to under your tree." 8) "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (Bruce Springsteen, live single 1978) How great is the Boss?. Taken from one of his concerts in 1978, when the E Street Band was in the prime of its strengths, this fun version of the classic Christmas song concentrates in a few minutes all the reasons why Springsteen and his group were the best live experience in Rock between 1975 and 1985. May Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici rest in peace, they made ??us happy for decades. Today the band is still excellent, but these memories... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rebS3FABeck "He sees you when you're sleeping / He knows when you're awake / He knows if you've been bad or good, So be good for goodness sake". 9) 'Father Christmas' (The Kinks, single ) It is curious that this list of great Christmas songs includes many tracks created during periods of low creativity and slump in popular success for some of the bands. The holiday muse seems to appear when the gold records become plywood ones. This song is another example. The Kinks were in a period of popularity downturn but their albums and lyrics were still wonderful. Ray Davies delivers one of his best and most cynical lyrics, removing the cliches of syrupy Christmas spirit. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-oVPVsCqs4 "Father Christmas, give us some money / Don't mess around with those silly toys / We'll beat you up if you do not hand it over / We want your bread so do not make us annoyed / Give all the toys to the little rich boys ". 10) "Christmas" (The Who's "Tommy") Pete Townshend wrote the first successful rock opera (not the first chronologically, the Pretty Things own that honour) and within it we can find this little song about Christmas for the deaf and mute boy, Tommy, as sung by his family. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDriHKfb6x8 "And Tommy doesn't know what day it is. He does not know who Jesus was or what praying is. How can he be saved? From the eternal grave." Other strong contenders: . Run Rudolph Run - Keith Richards or Lemmy Kilmister 's version .

John Paul Getty Fans of monetary stimulus always ignore the biggest and best push for the economy. Cheap energy. Finding oil and gas. The United States have achieved an economic stimulus equivalent to 1.3% of GDP thanks to the energy revolution brought by fracking. It is a very significant positive effect, both on the supply and demand side. - On the supply side, it has led the U.S. to be energy independent in gas and in oil very shortly. In October 2013, domestic crude oil production exceeded imports for the first time since 1995 (7.74 million barrels a day compared with imports of 7.57 million barrels per day). In fact, imports of crude oil in North America have dropped to the lowest level of the past 17 ??years. - On the demand side, although the economy is growing and industrial production increases, technological efficiency is improving consumption very significantly consumption. In 2008, the United States spent 10% of gross domestic product in energy. In 2013, it will not reach 8.5%. At the close of this article, the spread between U.S. benchmark oil (West Texas Intermediate) and the European benchmark (Brent) stood at nearly $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow to evacuate and export the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and that isolates the U.S. and Canada price as separate and autonomous market dynamics. The spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent is likely to remain at $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow evacuating and exporting the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and the Keystone filling is not enough to offset the rise of production. Total product demand in the US on a trailing four week basis is 20.1m b/d, +5.6% y/y. Gasoline demand is up 3.3%, distillate demand growth + 0.1% and jet fuel demand is up 8.1%. At 386mb crude stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range for December. Gasoline inventories are in the upper half of the average range. Distillate stocks are below the lower limit of the average range for this time of year. The price of gas in U.S. is $ 3.9/ mmbtu compared to the European average of $ 8.5 / mmbtu. More than twice. Meanwhile, in Japan, energy costs have skyrocketed in 2013 and the price at which the country imports liquefied natural gas exceeds $ 15/mmbtu ... five times more expensive than the U.S. gas. Not only the U.S. imports less, but the cost is lower than that of its competitors in the OECD countries. It is the way to energy independence in the U.S. I already commented in 2012 here. The effect produced by this energy revolution is twofold: - It greatly reduces the "geopolitical premium" to be added to the price of crude . Even though Brent reflects an obvious geopolitical risk, it is much smaller than in the past because the balance between supply and demand is very well covered. That the price of Brent is "only" $110 a barrel in an environment of decent demand growth and supply problems in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran is a clear proof of how well the market is supplied . Brent price dynamics is lateral, despite supply problems in Libya due to internal protests, which led the country to export less than 90,000 barrels per day (compared to the country's capacity of 1.25 million barrels per day), sanctions to Iran (which led the country to export about 1 million barrels a day, compared with its capacity of 2.5 million) and the political difficulties to boost production in Iraq after the war. In fact, Iraq is likely to slash its production guidance by 35%. Meanwhile, Iran is aiming at adding 500kbpd to supply, but technical challenges remain, more important than sanction lifting. At the OPEC meeting, Iran stated that it was ready to open its doors to the oil majors from Europe and the US, but the seven companies named by Iran to boost oil output are unanimously sceptical about the growth targets set by the country (BP, RDS, Total, ENI, Statoil, Exxon and Conoco). Not only the spare capacity of OPEC countries is adequate to address specific risks, but the oil price still includes a negative impact of production incidents - unexpected cuts to supply from military or political crises - of 2.7 million barrels a day. If those unexpected cuts are normalized, the geopolitical premium in oil prices will fall further . OPEC held its meeting for the half year and, unsurprisingly, maintained its production quota of 30 mbpd. The return to normal production in Libya could add 1m bpd, but the future rise in production in Iraq is under threat, and I see it impossible to take the country's production from 3mbpd to 4mbpd in 2014 or mid-2015. A possible lifting of the embargo on Iran might enable the country to produce and export an additional 500kbpd. As such, it is virtually impossible that, even with Libya and Iran returning, OPEC production would reach 33 mb/d. Therefore the call on OPEC stays at 29-30 mbpd in 2014. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Emirates are expected to balance the market cutting part of the production that they increased to offset the Iran embargo. It requires a maximum cut of 1.1mbpd to tighten the market aggressively. There is enough spare capacity and the incremental production comes from so-called "safe" countries, the U.S. in particular. Of the newly added production capacity in the oil value chain -1.3 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.7 million in 2014- most comes from North America (including Canada), at a low cost and with an EROEI higher than 8x, ie, competitive and sustainable. This creates greater stability and less risk. It is an environment where price is acceptable for producers and consumers, where the "oil burden" in the OECD -cost of foreign-imported oil- does not reach 6.5% of gross domestic product. The possibility of excess supply in the next three years is not small. There is plenty of oil and the extra barrels that arrive to the system come from countries with lower political difficulties. The EIA (Energy Information Administration) announced that in the second quarter of 2013 global oil production exceeded demand. Although this dynamic might change, as many analysts expect, it will not get to 55% of the average difference between consumption and production of the last five years. In my opinion, the supply of crude oil and liquids will probably exceed demand growth estimates -1.1 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.2 in 2014 -. Why? Because this increase depends critically on China to continue to grow in a way that many consider questionable, as I explained in my article "Careful with China", and the "efficiency" effect is already part of the policy of the Chinese Communist Party itself. Crude imports from China fell by 13.8% in 2013 (4.8 million barrels/day to October). What does this mean? The incremental oil demand comes mostly from emerging countries which , as we all know, tend to suffer abrupt periods of expansion and decline. In fact, my estimates of demand growth indicate an extremely modest increase, which would lead to oil prices evolving with little more than inflation. That the OECD is facing a mid-term future where oil-price shocks are becoming less frequent and have less impact, as the effect of new technologies -renewables- and efficiency take hold. The surprise may be that in 2014 crude prices continue losing that "geopolitical premium" while the US energy revolution continues. A "real stimulus" for OECD countries. Yes, I know, the naysayers will say that oil is running out, that liquids do not count, that all is a lie, that demand will always grow as if technology and efficiency were inexistent, but the reality is different. The last barrel of oil will not cost millions of dollars. It will be worth zero. Because by then, if the threats of depletion were remotely true-and they are not- oil would have been replaced as major source of energy. Never bet against human ingenuity. Even the most optimistic would have never estimated the success of the energy revolution that has occurred in the U.S.. The oil market is well supplied and the impact of shocks is falling. I am sorry for the naysayers, doom-forecasters, we are going to have plenty of oil for many, many decades. For companies, dividends are under threat: Over the last 4 quarters, Europes five oil majors have generated negative Free Cash Flow of -$1.5bn and declared dividends of $35bn. In the long run, this situation is not sustainable. If we exclude the US oil supermajors, which spend 25bn in buybacks from Free Cash Flow, the sector generates negative Free Cash Flow at $110/bbl, particularly the national oil companies, including Petrobras and Petrochina. The problem is refining and high taxation (that is why US companies do better on FCF yield despite losing money on shale gas). At the same time,  for European companies, capex has continued to surprise on the upside, leading to an increase in one-year forward consensus expectations from ~$105bn at the end of 2011 to the current level of ~$125bn. This has been driven by further cost inflation, but also an increase in the investment opportunities that are accessible to the oil majors, largely as a result of unconventional projects including shale gas. After a period of being opportunity-constrained, in the mid-2000s, the sector is currently opportunity-rich, and oil companies have clearly been eager to capitalize on this. Global capex in Upstream remains above $600 billion a year, which is critical to the continuing super cycle of services. It is not a question of cost, safety in a post Macondo world and unit costs (service charges have dropped to less than 20% of overall project costs despite a massive increase in projects, margins and investment, this is because projects are larger, more complex and more skewed to non-conventional). The oil and gas upstream capex cycle remains at the core of the overall supply cycle and is divided into six different market activities each of which has its own balance of supply, demand and inventories. 1. Acquiring/relinquishing acreage (flat in 2014 at $150bn) 2. Acquiring an inventory of seismic knowledge (on the rise) 3. Exploratory drilling-designed to find new resources (on the rise) 4. Delineation drilling  designed to prove up reserves (on the rise) 5. Development  huge capital deployment to bring proved reserves to market (flat) 6. Deciding on whether to extend the life of producing properties, or whether to prematurely abandon them.(flat) Exploration capex is likely to rise for the first time in 10 years above $160bn, which is a very positive scenario for drillers and seismic. So how does this play out positively for services if clients-companies are not generating FCF at $110/bbl and capex is at all-time high?. When deciding to cut capex, oil companies always start with the largest part (35%) items 5 and 6, but the other elements are largely against companys targets, interests and competitive position if they are cut. This underpins my view that the super cycle in services remains in 2014 despite a flat oil price environment. And I believe companies will address the imbalance in Free Cash Flow cutting dividends, not capex (as highlighted in 3Q results). More read: CNBC ]] The United States has had five years of elevated joblessness and subpar growth - John Cassidy In 1982,  Fleetwood Mac released an album called "Mirage", giving a false impression of collaboration and partnership between the turmoil, hatred and grudges. Nevertheless, it sold several million copies. The mirage of our days may be the expectation of 2.9% growth in the United States in 2014. And it also sells a lot. The US is growing. All is well. Unemployment is low. Expansionary policy works. Does it? Not only it is not, but the most important economists of the Federal Reserve are warning about it. Look at yesterday's GDP by categories: The "headline" +3.6% growth hides a meagre +1.9% ex-inventories. Q3 Consumer Spending +1.4%, was the weakest since December 2009. Business Inventory added 1.7% to +3.6% GDP, the most since 2011. In fact, real final sales (core GDP, ex-inventories) was actually revised down to just 1.9%. (Graph from Business Insider) The Federal Reserve acknowledged in its last meeting that the macroeconomic data is still disappointing, with weak growth and poor employment. This graph shows it, but the stock market is rising and house prices are rocketing... "Perception of wealth" they call it. Sure, for those who already own stocks or property. Meanwhile more than 65% of property sales are made without mortgage... The perverse incentive to flood markets with easy money generates a massively leveraged economy (check margin debt, at record highs), moves capital to the financial sector and sinks productive investment. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is becoming more like a souffle , filled with air . Not only companies spend less, but the money is used to buy back stock, pay dividends and exchange capital in mergers and acquisitions, and not for added productive investment. Between 1996 and 2006 the largest companies in the U.S. (S P 500) invested about one trillion dollars per year, of which 70% was devoted to capex and RD while 30% to buyback and dividends. Since 2009 the annual number of total invested capital has soared to over $2.3 trillion, but 45% is used to buy back shares and pay dividends. In fact, neither the figure of productive investment or RD have increased substantially, inflation-adjusted, since 1998. That is, the 'free' money from the expansionary policy is used  for protection, reducing the number of outstanding shares, merge and return cash to shareholders, not to expand organically  (data from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley). The U.S. has created nearly half of all the money supply of its history in the past five years, and has lived the longest period ever seen without raising interest rates, and yet the labour participation rate (percentage of civil population of the United States with over 16 years of age or more who have a job or are actively looking for one) has fallen to 1978 levels, 62.8%. Some explain this due to "the demographic effect". However, adjusting for these demographic changes -there are fewer young workers and the older ones are living longer-, the labour force participation and employment has not improved since 2010 while the country engaged in money printing like crazy. Improving unemployment by 'taking people off the lists', as in Europe in the early 90s. Meanwhile, almost half of the working population in the U.S. earns less than $40,000 per annum. From Michael Purves: "Payrolls this week report came in with an impressive 203k gain and a 7.0% unemployment print. More importantly the jobs additions drew from a wide variety of sectors, including manufacturing, and not the lower wage and more temporary job additions we have seen in earlier reports. The underemployment rate (U-6) also fell from 13.8% to 13.2%, representing the sharpest percentage drop  since 2008.   The most significant aspect of this report is not the numbers per se, but that the numbers were achieved in the context of notably higher interest rates.  However, there are still notable signs of  weakness: the participation rate (despite an uptick this morning) is still in a down trend, and we are still not seeing a significant improvement in average hourly earnings, or average weekly hours". Additionally, personal income decreased 0.1% and disposable personal income (DPI) decreased 0.2% in October. Monetary policy is proving to be a key driver of massive inequality, and benefiting only those that held assets or have access to massive debt. The greatest swindle since the miracle medicine men of the Wild West is to say that monetary policy is redistributive and social. But do not worry, they say, "next year, it will be better", "Just wait." Look at the Hiring Plans Index since 2011 (graphs from MS). The balance of the U.S. Federal Reserve is rapidly approaching a staggering $4 trillion dollars, buying about a billion a year in bonds, yet the economy is growing well below its potential ... but also that potential is deteriorating . QE does not create jobs exhibit 1: Exhibit 2: Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion vs Job Creation In the last two weeks I've read two excellent reports from Federal reserve economists William English and David Wilcox warning about the deterioration of the actual and potential growth of the United States. The  graph of one of these reports shows how the correlation between potential and real GDP has broken, well below the trend from 2000 to 2007. Companies do not invest in productive activities and job creation because conditions for confidence are simply not there. Artificially low rates and printing money may deceive a few analysts, but not presidents and CEOs of companies that have been able to be leaders and global competitors despite any government interference. Tax increases and financial repression destroy consumption, money velocity and job creation in the medium term. Goldman Sachs estimates that in 2014 capex and productive investment will grow by 9%. Analysing estimates and guidance for 2014 of most SP 500 companies, I doubt it. At best, it will be flat year-on-year. Government cannot replace private sector capex. Despite the low government bond yields and eternal lift of the debt ceiling, the U.S. continues to generate a massive deficit, projected at around $744 billion for Fiscal Year 2014. To 'fill' the loss of productive investment, assuming -which is a lot- that governments would spend wisely- the deficit would have to shoot another half a trillion dollars, and with it comes higher tax increases, more financial repression and... less productive investment. True, banks are stronger and have less risk and government is borrowing at low rates. Of course they are, with a QE that is an equivalent of 6.7% of US GDP as an annual gift. Increasing money supply by 6-7% to grow GDP by 2% is not growth, it's stretching the pizza dough. However, a problem of wrong incentives, creating fake money and artificially low rates not only dilutes the real growth but impairs its potential one. The solution that Keynesian economists offer? ... Repeat. "Until investors give in" as Paul Krugman says. More fuel to the fire. As growth is poor, what they propose is more booze to the alcoholic. Low rates forever. Yes, many members of the U.S. central bank, like Charles Plosser,  expressed doubts about the effectiveness of monetary policy, and begin to propose measures to control the madness limiting the ability of the Fed to buy assets and expand its balance sheet, but these are still voices in the desert. If you really think that forcing the machine will revive investment and job creation because it is decided by a committee, it will not happen. Until the job creators clearly see the opportunities, investment will remain low. Reasons for concern: - Credit conditions are deteriorating alarmingly, which leads me to believe that productive investment will stagnate in 2014 . Estimates of increase of 9% do not agree with any of the messages thrown by the companies that published results and guidance. - Deterioration of the leading indicators of job creation, new businesses, corporate margins and capex have accelerated since September and came into contraction long before the government shutdown. - Estimates of profits in the industrial and consumer sector have fallen between 8% and 10% for 2014. - In March, another drama on account of the debt ceiling and overspending  and no small risk of tax hikes. With the popularity of President Obama at a minimum-37% -, the likelihood of tax increases to 'the rich', which is always translated into 'tax hikes for all', is high. - The so-called Obamacare -mistakenly sold as the panacea of universal public health-, means about 52 billion dollars in new taxes to small businesses in particular, and the lowest estimate of the negative impact on employment that I have read is 800,000 people . Yes, I know. For the stock market investor most of this is irrelevant. The worse, the better, and $85 billion of monthly asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, even if it is trimmed, makes everyone happy because the 'helicopter money' only helps the financial sector and the state, so we will 'party like it's 1999' for a while. Furthermore, investors are protected by many companies who do not fall into the trap of easy money, because they are the first to suffer when the music stops. I am sure that the innovative spirit of the country will prevail, but to estimate its economic development through the moves of a stock market impacted by share repurchases and 'laughing gas money' may be an illusion. Richard Koo warned that the U.S. is engaged in "the QE trap" from which you can not get out easily or comfortably. As Fleetwood Mac ... Can't Go Back.

Capesize rates have fallen 48% in a week to $17k per day. This has been driven by spot chartering falling to 72 vessels relative to the highs of 161 vessels chartered seen at the peaks in December. - . Iron Ore imports are on hold after stockpiles in major Chinese ports have gone to 82mt versus 71mt average in 2013. Chinese crude steel output has fallen driven by pollution control measures as well. . Panamax rates have fallen 7% in a week due to the suspension of Colombian coal shipments until March by Drummond, the worlds 4 th largest coal exporter. - . Crude tanker rates (VLCCs) have fallen 28% in a week to $30k per day, as vessels to the US are reducing given lower imports. These moves justify the decline back to September levels, as the previous increases arrived from short term big rate improvements driven by re-stocking in India and China and an increase in refinery utilization and oil imports- from the US. In essence, rates are returning to a normalized level of small improvement from the lows but a shipping environment that is still oversupplied and global commerce is not improving drastically , and definitely not even close to 2007 levels. The moves up in rates in October-December were driven by one-off events that drove to a short-term tightness in very particular segments (Capesize and Panamax). ]] Brent down 3.2% MTD at c$107/bbl. WTI at $94/bbl (-4%). Differential has settled around $13/bbl. US production at a 25-year high. Global oil supply at 92.23m b/d, up 1.16m b/d or 1.3% y/y. Within this OPEC supplies increased 310k b/d m/m to 29.82m b/d on higher output from Saudi Arabia the UAE. Iraq was the only member to post a monthly decline in December. Effective spare capacity is estimated at 3.33m b/d in Dec. Non-OPEC supplies declined 340k b/d in Dec to 55.99m b/d, with Brazilian ethanol production responsible for most of the decline. In November US oil production exceeded 8m b/d level for the first time since 1988, with the main drivers being Texas shale plays, a return of Gulf of Mexico output from maintenance and a solid contribution from Alaska. Crude has been helped by stronger product demand as the US prepared for another cold snap. China GDP data released early this morning shows GDP for 4Q at +7.7% vs market at 7.6%. Data also shows December oil demand down 10.6% and a Reuters calculation has China crude demand for 2013 up a small 1.6%. In Libya there are reports of fighting in the south with the government using its airforce to bomb fighters it claims are loyal to the former Gadaffi regime while plans are now being prepared by the government to re-take eastern export terminals currently under the control of rebels. CFTC data released on Friday for the week to 14 Jan showed speculators cutting net long futures/options positions by 16,568 to 281,802 contracts. US refinery utilization stands at 90.0% vs. a 5-year average of 84.9%. 4-week average gasoline demand was up 3.0% YoY, and 4-week average distillate demand was up 10.3% YoY. Coal is up 4% this month at $86.60/mt driven by Chinese data showing solid but lower growth. Looks at risk of de-rating from here. China expects total energy consumption to rise 3.5% y-o-y in 2014  NEA forecasts Chinas total energy consumption may rise to 3.89bt of std. coal in 2014, assuming energy elasticity down to 0.43 from 0.506 in 2013. And the share of non-fossil and natural gas consumption could reach 10.7% and 6.1%. CO2 is flat this month at v5.05/mt. A  leaked document claims that on 22nd Jan the EU will suggest reform of the CO2 market should centre on a market stability reserve to enable the market to better adjust to economic changes, but only from 2021. Hard to see that near-term impacting prices much. US gas has been flat at $4.2/mmbtu. Total working storage is now at 2,530 Bcf, 659 Bcf below last year's 3,189 Bcf and 443 Bcf below the 5-year average of 2,973 Bcf. Despite record withdrawals, supply-demand balance remains ample. UK gas is down 2% at 66p/therm. Storage is at 4,011mcm (84.34% full), unlikely to drive prices higher. Power prices in Europe do not improve... As industrial demand and thermal capacity continue to erode peak pricing power. Germany at 36.95/mwh and Nordpool at 33.85/mwh ]] US gas ends the year as the king of commodities, up 19% YTD at $4.31/mmbtu as the injection trend reversed to a bullish storage withdrawal in the past two months. Looking to 2014, exports + coal plant retirements adding 3bcf/d of demand keep me confident of improvi ng US gas prices. Total working storage is now at 2,974 Bcf, 562 Bcf below last year's 3,536 Bcf and 289 Bcf below the 5-year average of 3,263 Bcf. Oil ends the year as the only other commodity up yoy. Brent up 7% ytd at $111.38/bbl an d WTI at $99m14/bbl. The differential at $12.25. Demand growth has been better than expected and supply disruptions took 800kbpd of oil in the system. Looking to 2014 I see less supply risks and healthier demand, bringing the call on OPEC down to 29mmbpd. US will be the lion share of non-OPEC supply, keeping a wide WTI discount because of it. 2015 will see US as biggest oil producer above Saudi Arabia. UK gas at 69p/th ends the year up 6% yoy. The picture of tight supply and inventories plus most LNG absorbed by Japan will likely ease in 2014, to see a more moderate picture of supply-demand helped by cheaper spot LNG as japanese nuclear comes back gradually. Coal at $82.40/mt ends the year down 13.3% and 2014 sees a similar picture of oversupply and poor demand growth. Demand to increase by 1.5% versus supply at 3.5% is not bullish. CO2 crashed 30% in 2013 and ends saved partially by EU efforts to contain oversupply. At 4.67/mt, backloading only addressed a small part of the oversupply of EUAs and renewables continue to eat out of thermal generation while industrial production doesn't pick up in Europe. A flat 2014 is likely. German power prices at 36.70/mwh down 16% ytd, Nordpool at 32/mwh down 15% ytd... The picture is not bullish for 2014 because of the same reasons as CO2, but power prices seem to have bottomed out and the curve reflects a small inflation into 2015 as EU reduces commitment to Kyoto in favour of growth policies. 2014 doesn't look like a year of mass commodity inflation, which bodes well for the recovery, and prices remain attractive for consumers and producers. With the oil burden at less than 5-6% of global GDP and gas well supplied and within the trading range, it's a good environment for everyone without causing a 2008 supply shock that halts the economy. ]] The real goal should be reduced government spending, rather than balanced budgets achieved by ever rising tax rates to cover ever rising spending. Thomas Sowell Spanish bond yields have fallen to pre-crisis levels despite debt to GDP reaching c100%, a deficit that will be above the target 6.5% and refinancing needs of c224bn in 2014. The "Draghi put", added to much better comps on unemployment (fallen by 147k in 2013), consumer spending (+2% in December) and added to expectations of an 0.5%-1% growth in GDP have helped. But challenges remain. Debt (public and private above 300% of GDP), unemployment (26%) are still too high, and 0.5-1% growth is simply not enough. . Spanish banks dependence on the ECB will fall from the 220.5bn of November but is still very high. In that month the Spanish Banks long-term ECB borrowings dropped by 12.0bn. . Bank Non-Performing Loan Ratio. This ratio likely continued to rise in November (from 13.0% in October). In the next few months, the NPL ratio should continue to rise, although at a slower pace. . Taxes: 40 tax raises between 2011 and 2014. And raised again in the beginning of 2014 to try to collect one billion euro more, increasing Social Security contributions as well, affecting mostly SMEs and self-employed. Prime Minister Rajoy will be in Washington (13 and 14-January). On Monday he will meet with Christiane Lagarde just a few days before the IMF releases the update of its 2014 growth forecast. The IMF could raise its forecast for Spain from the current +0.2%. On Tuesday, he will meet with the US Chamber of Commerce. I read different analysis of Spain's growth potential. Among all OECD countries, Spain is the only one that shows more divergence between expected growth (+0.5-1%) and its potential (+3% according to BBVA, Goldman Sachs and Merill Lynch). This is the opportunity cost of holding on to the 2004 model of state intervention and bureaucracy. I estimate Spains growth for 2014 at 1% and assume 250k net job creation, but this is far away from its potential. Only by laying out the red carpet to job creation and improving the opportunities to do business, Spain would attract direct financial investments of 50 billion euro and would create much more new net jobs. By lowering SMEs and self-employed taxes, the UK did not only increase its revenue collection by 24 billion pounds, it also reduced the unemployment rate to 7%... being a net receiver of immigration. The formula: business is great and low taxes. Meanwhile, in Spain, we keep trying to hunt the unicorns of  recovering tax revenues and telling ourselves that we dont have a spending problem. At the peak of the real estate bubble Spain never collected more than 412 billion euro of tax revenues. However, it spends above 70 billion euro more than this historical high tax receipts of 2007, which will never return. A minimum of 30 billion euro per annum of higher expenses than bubble-peak revenues even if we deduct aid to banks and one-offs. I talk about it in my book Viaje a la Libertad Economica" ("Journey to economic freedom). In Spain, tax revenues have not collapsed because of fraud or the black economy, but due to the enormous dependency on construction and civil works which reached almost 20% GDP including services and grids for a demand growth that never arrived. A bubble of overcapacity to inflate artificially the country's GDP. And this GDP, artificially increased by stimulating internal demand brought as a consequence a 300% of debt. The problem is such inflated GDP figure (c20% according to independent analysts) is the same GDP that is used to tell us that the country collects less taxes than the other countries. Using ratios on the grounds of an artificial GDP to justify bubble spending and confiscatory taxes. It is the same subterfuge of me selling to myself something that I dont need and I cant afford, with debt, and then say that my business is growing, justifying by this way an unacceptable spending level. Spain's 2014 budget doesnt correct that spending problem yet, and public spending remains above 2007 levels, meanwhile families' disposable income and economic activity has fallen to 2004 levels, being optimistic. It's the public spend aristocracy. According to the 2014 Budget data Spain will be spending 10 billion euro in subsidies; 23 billion in coordination and finance relationships with territorial authorities; 690 million in State foreign action; 497 million in development cooperation; 131 million in cultural diffusion abroad; in peripheral State administration 275 million; in news coverage 55 million; another 83 million in meteorology (yes, I swear); actions to prevent climate change another 42 million; official cars spend raises 1.6% to 240 million; the mutual healthcare, which is parallel to public healthcare, means another 2 billion. Yet we hear that there is no scope for further cuts. But the problem is that we dont give solutions for the two problems which are obstructing the economic recovery: - A "Sheriffs of Nottingham" taxation system that is more worried about collecting the last coin and sustaining, at all cost, the unsustainable spending, instead of creating good conditions for economic growth and with them generate more tax revenues. When I read reform to increase tax bases reduce deductions it really means raise taxes. Spain is the country where fiscal pressure has increased more since 1965 after Turkey. Fiscal pressure at 40% ranks among the highest in the EU ( read here ) - Legal uncertainty perception. If the tax and legal environment are not clear and predictable it will be very hard to attract financial investment to create jobs and put capital in the economy for the long-term. Not to buy bonds and shares, but investing in sectors capable of making Spain recover real growth. If the system is seen ad unpredictable and risks of retroactive changes, long term investment doesn't arrive. Spain lost ten positions in the ranking of "doing business" of the Heritage Foundation (46 from 36 before). - Useless spend sustains a level of bureaucracy whose objective is to justify itself with endless rules (state, region, local) and ridiculous procedures. I recommend you to read the additional competences given to the regional authorities or the unproductive subsidies, for example. This bureaucracy and complexity acts as a block to new investment and job creation. Between 2008 and 2011 public spending in the Eurozone increased almost 7% to nearly 4.65 billion. In southern countries, the most affected by the so-called austerity, at least in theory, the evolution is similar: From 2008 public spending has grown 8.6% in France, 4% in Spain, 3% in Italy and 7.8% in Portugal. However, economic activity and disposable income have fallen to 2004 levels. Instead of considering that spending must be adapted to the economic cycles and that prosperity always had come from saving, we start to thinking that an excessive spending problem will be fixed with more spending. To spending there is always a reason, the "position rent" is created. Once this bureaucratic entity is created  justifying it is easier than restricting/cutting it. Look at Spain's loss-making public companies. Only four out of 4.000 have been closed. However, there is never a margin to lower taxes and boost the economy. There is nothing more permanent than a temporal raise of taxes. Then, when the country gets into depression, the "solution offered" is more public spending as the way out of the crisis which has been created by excessive spending in the first place. Everyone sees the enormous potential of Spain. Growing 1% in 2014 its fine. Thinking that this is enough and we dont have to reduce more superfluous spending is dangerous. 2014 will be much better than consensus estimates. I dont doubt it. But it could be much better. There is a huge potential and, if Spain wants, it can surpass it.

The first scoring system dichotomized all clinical predictors but required inducing a cough. The second scoring system removed induced cough as a clinical abnormality but required distinguishing between three levels of nasal discharge severity. The third system removed induced cough and forced a dichotomized variable for nasal discharge. The first system presented in this study used the following predictors and assigned values: coughing (induced or spontaneous coughing, 2 points), nasal discharge (any discharge, 3 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (?39.2C or 102.5F, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized BRD positive if their total score was ?4. This system correctly classified 95.4% cases and 88.6% controls.

A research made by Microsoft, UNESCO, INTEL, ... across 7 countries asking students, teachers and school leaders about how school is changing and moving towards the 21st century skills. Finland, Russia, Indonesia, Australia, UK, Mexico and Senegal The report is large but I'll just comment a few ideas that quickly came to mind mind while reading. "while ICT use in teaching is becoming more common, ICT use by students in their learning is still an exception" Teachers use technology but things didn't change that much with it. Of course we provided variety to our lessons and we are able to show videos, audio and animations which help students to understand better the concepts, but in principle is the same: we are talking and they are listening. Unless we extend our richer lessons beyond the classroom and our students can reach to the contents 24/7. These thing we couldn't do it before ICT in education. "even when the ICT are used by the students, the level of complexity of the uses is low and the tasks are  individual and used for personal improvement" Internet searches, report writing or practising routine skills don't give our students further knowledge. It is diffeent, which is good, but it is pretty much the same than we do before. The ITL research that these simple uses of the ICT in the lessons take the 79% of the uses, while the high level uses of the ICT, those that give our students skills to afford future works, are barely offered in a 20% of the cases. "21st century skills are not clearly defined, and there is no clear idea how to design associated learning activities" We are still teaching using a model that didn't change in the last 50 years; we are still preparing our students for works that don't exist. But the problem is that those skills that we are teaching are the easiest to evaluate. Routine task are very easy to assess. You know them or not. Project based learning, knowledge building or solving problems are not that easy. Students learn future skills when educators structure learning activities that require them. We have to trust that giving the skills we'll reach the contents with even more efficiency that using teachers based models. "using such a different countries in the researches we got consistent results and we realize that problems are basically the same everywhere" These results could be taken form every school in every country of the world no matter if it's public or private; if it's in a city or in a little village. What we need is to face this reality and try to develop skills and competences with the resources we have. "Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little." Edmond Burke Let me finish with antoher quote which gives the title of this post. It was said by Prof. Seymour Papert (1998) the father of educational computing: "My goal in life is to find ways in which children can use technology as a constructive medium to do things that they could not do before; to do things at a level of complexity that was not previously accessible to children ]] Ovi Barcelo (Spain, Microsoft certified trainer), Luis Fernandes (Portugal, Microsoft expert educator) and Joao Cunha (Portugal, Microsoft expert educator) have built a bilingual blog to help you choose the best applications for education available at Microsoft Store in Windows 8.

What if  "We will no longer search for information and contents, they will find us via social media". I don't see it faraway from where we are right now. Students are recording their activity while they are surfing across different social media, and as the advertisement are changing depending on the webs they are visiting and the clicks that they are doing, the contents and information around their searches are changing depending on it. So, again, the information will look for us. Social media knows a lot about us, so, why this information will not be used to select what kind of information we want to know? But the question is: Where are we teachers in all this new environment? For me the answer is clear: In the school with our students, as always. What is changing (I believe it has already changed) is what are we doing there? If we are still the main source of information, we won't be outdated soon, we are already outdated! How can be compete against the information is in the Net? 10+1 tips to be a real 21st century (and beyond) teacher: Not all the information is found in the Internet is true. Help your students to be critical with the information they find. Is very pretentious to think that students will learn by their own. Motivate your students to learn and to build their own knowledge. The process is long. It is not only about getting information. Guide your students to the process of getting the information, processing it and assessing it, in order to get profit of it. Society today is practical. Focus your lessons in "Real-life" issues closer to your students. Play Probably this is the most difficult part, but assessment has to change. It will be a loss of time if we end it up with an regular exam. Assess the whole process of learning but not only the content . Listen to your students . They can help us to improve our methods. Update yourself . We all know how difficult is to be updated nowadays, but if we want to atlk their own language we have to know something about their world. Build knowledge relating different areas in your curriculum . Isolated subjects have less and less meaning these days. Social studies, languages or ICT skills, for example, are very difficult to forget while you want your students to do an Internet research. Be patient . Don't change the world in one day. Don't blame on the national standards, the lack of resources or your students behavior. As I said to my students. Take the plunge! Move one step ahead.

Now I will redirect the post to the official site where you can find the files and the best instructions. http://docs.moodle.org/19/en/Installing_Moodle C) Create a subdomain Depending on your hosting there are multiple options but they are mostly the same. Login into your host panel. Youll see the link domains Create a subdomain the the user interface. Youll find a button like create a subdomain or something like this Write the name of your subdomain. for example  edu.domain.com D) Start your live@edu campus Go to http://www.microsoft.com/liveatedu/enroll-and-deploy-process.aspx and click on the button "Enroll your school" at the upper right part of the screen. Click on the radio button Ready to enroll in the next screen. Step 1 of 2 . Fill the information required to identify your school. The most important part is the last field Domain Here you have to type the subdomain you would like to use in your live@edu mail address. For example, in this case the email addresses will be mary@edu.domain.com Step 2 of 2 . Fill the fields with the administrator information, password and ID E) Confirm ownership of the domain. This part could be a bit tricky if your are not familiar with domains and hostings. The easiest way is using an MX record. You will find the option in Alternative methods to prove domain ownership The MX record used to prove domain ownership must be in the exact format displayed when you are asked to prove ownership. For example, if your token is 0cbc8689f5394f86bc7b84983e30d3, specify the following: Target or Destination or Mail Server 0cbc8689f5394f86bc7b84983e30d3.msv1.invalid Priority 100 or Low Typically, DNS records that you create for new domains are detected quickly. Updates to the DNS records of existing domains may take longer to be detected. However, it should take no longer than 72 hours before the new record is detected. Until the new DNS record is detected, the Service Management Portal will display the message asking you to confirm domain ownership. To check if the DNS record has been detected, click Refresh. Detailed instructions for specific domain registrars Create DNS Records at 11 for Live@edu Create DNS Records at CentralNic for Live@edu Create DNS Records at eNom Central for Live@edu Create DNS Records at GoDaddy.com for Live@edu Create DNS Records at Network Solutions for Live@edu Create DNS Records at Register.com for Live@edu Create DNS Records at Yahoo! for Live@edu Create DNS Records using BIND for Live@edu Create DNS records using Windows-Based DNS for Live@edu Now click the refresh button in your admin page (Remember that it is in http://eduadmin.live.com ) your ownership will be confirmed. F) Create User Accounts After you set up a Live@edu domain and configure DNS to direct e-mail to it, you're ready to create user accounts. Each user account has its own Windows Live ID and a mailbox with 10 GB of storage. There are two ways to create user accounts with the Exchange Control Panel. Read on to decide which works best for you. Create accounts one at a time If you have to create a few test users or occasionally create a new user, use the Exchange Control Panel. To do this, sign in to the Exchange Control Panel, and select Manage My Organization Users Groups Mailboxes New. Create lots of user accounts If you have to create a lot of user accounts during initial user provisioning, you can use the Exchange Control Panel to import users using a CSV file. This is the easiest way to create lots of accounts. Again, sign in the Exchange Control Panel, and select Manage My Organization Users Groups Mailboxes Import users. Video: Exchange Online: How To: Bulk Import Users using a CSV file Watch this demo to learn how to import new users Here you can see an example of CSV file This table describes the attributes required to import new users. The import process will fail if any one of these attributes isn't included in the header row of the CSV import file. Note Type the attributes exactly as they are shown. Attributes can't contain spaces. They must be a single word. For example, First Name is invalid. You must use FirstName . Attribute Description Name Name specifies an identifier for the user. The value for Name must be unique in your domain. Important The value of Name is used as the display name in the list of mailboxes in the Exchange Control Panel and in the shared address book if you don't include the DisplayName attribute, which is an optional attribute. EmailAddress EmailAddress specifies the e-mail address of a new user. It is also used to create the corresponding Windows Live ID. The value of EmailAddress must be unique in your domain. FirstName FirstName specifies the user's first name. LastName LastName specifies the user's last name. Password Password is the initial password assigned to a new Windows Live ID that is created for a mailbox user. If you are a Live@edu organization, you can force users to change their password when they sign in to their account for the first time by using the ForceChangePassword attribute. Note The option to require users to change their password isn't available for Microsoft Office 365 e-mail organizations. Live@edu is set. A lot of features can be changed and personalized now, but with these steps you are ready to roll! G) Create users in Moodle You can use the same CSV file to import the users to Moodle, but with some changes. Copy and paste the CSVf file and your computer and change the name of the columns, like this. live@edu moodle Name username EmailAddress email FirstName firstname LastName lastname P assword password But a very important thing is to add 2 more columns in the CSV for Moodle. auth In this column you have to write liveid for all the users msn In this column you have to write the students live@edu mail address. H) Install the plugin in Moodle 1. Add the block live services to your moodle Download the plugin from its official site clicking on  Try it . Unzip it and upload it by FTP to your Moodle site. It will use many folders, but if you upload it directly with the distribution given in the .zip, all the files will be correctlly placed. This is how the folder looks: 2. Update moodle to recognise the block live id From the Moodle administration, click on "Notifications" The system will install the plugin automatically 3. Creating the app Now we have to login with our liveID into https://manage.dev.live.com/ to create an app Create new application (From  My apps  and  create application ) a) Give a name and set the language b) Our app has created a  Client ID  and a  Cliente Secret"  which well use later. c) Let's edit the app options so we need to go to  API settings  and edit, in  redirect domain  the URL of our Moodle site followed by /auth/liveid/webauth-handler.php 4. Configuring the block in moodle Now is the moment to activate all the work to make it run  in Moodle So we go to Users Authentication Manage authentication And show (clicking on the eye to open it) the option Windows Live ID  In the same screen, at the bottom we can add an html code to show an "liveID login box" in the login page of Moodle. It could be something like this. div style="font-size:120%" pspan style="font-family: 'Segoe UI Light', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 1.6em;color: #333333;"Utiliza tu img alt="Windows Live" height="23" longdesc="Windows Live Logo" src= http://yourdomain.com/blocks/live_services/shared/images/WindowsLive.png width="175" IDbr / para autenticarte en Moodle/spanspan style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', 'Felt Tip Roman', 'Comic Sans MS';font-size: 1.6em;color: #333333;" siempre!/span/p div style="line-height:32px" a href= http://yourdomain.com/auth/liveid/login.php style="background:transparent url( http://yourdomian.com/blocks/live_services/shared/images/glossybutton88.gif) no-repeat scroll top right;height: 32px;width:88px;display: block;float:left;margin-right: 0px;text-decoration: none;text-align:center;color: #333333;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;font-weight:normal;"span style="height: 32px;display: block;float:left;margin-right: 0px;text-decoration: none;color: #333333;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;font-weight:normal;line-height:12px;padding:9px 0px 11px 0px;background: transparent url( http://yourdomain.com/blocks/live_services/shared/images/glossybtn32.gif) no-repeat;; background-color: transparent"Entra/span/a /div 5. Set the secret key and application id to your Moodle Go to the options: Modules Blocks Microsoft Live Services a) Type the data of our app b) Mail and calendar. If you activate it your students will access to their mail and calendar with a simple click and without leaving the Moodle. In  Service Account  type the impersonation account (in the next step I will explain how to create an impersonation account ) of live@edu and its password and in the Outlook URL you should write the address of your inbox without the /owa part , not even the final /. b.1) Create an impersonation account. These kind of accounts allow the Outlook users to login into their mailboxes without typing again user and password and doing it from an external application Create in the control panel of live@edu ( http://domains.live.com ) an account like this impersonation@yourdomian.com Now run locally Windows PowerShell in administrator mode and type: $LiveCred = Get-Credential Login as live@edu administrator $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell/ -Credential $LiveCred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection Get into the users administration Import-PSSession $Session And finally New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name:EWSImpersonation -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:impersonation@yourdomain.com It will give permissions to impersonation . c) Messenger y Bing. If we want Bing and Messenger just activate both of them. About searching a couple of things: There are two buttons in the search bar The regular search in Bing. Typing and searching, Powerset Search . I didn't know it before. To use it, select a text and click on the button. The words highlighted will be searched in Bing. Note: The Java script in MS4M.zip is not working properly. I have fixed it  - search.js, here .- Just overwrite the file in http://yourdomain/blocks/live_services/services/search 7. Mesenger within the courses Set a   Sticky block  Just choose from the dropdown menu course page and the block Microsoft Live Services New " home-made " block I have programmed a HTML block to implement in moodle once you can access to it with your LiveID. With it, you can: Create a new document with just one click. ( Word, Excel, PowerPoint or OneNote) Upload a document Access to "Shared documents" Make a document search in Skydrive The first step is create a new HTML block. Let's see the code step-by step:: 1.

A: We can not expect from schools and students to forget about their "addiction" and to get back into a life where mobile phones don't exist and they were not part of our daily life. Q: Young people have a very active virtual social life. They spend more time working in their virtual friends than with the real social interaction. A: If they are spending so much time within a social network, is it not an important part of their life? If we expect a global education taking care about every student perspective, we can't forget about their life in the social networks, as we can not forget about sports, arts or social skills. Q: Students today the can't afford frustration. A: I have seen them trying and trying after a "Game Over" screen in a video game. We have thousand different ways of introducing video games in the curriculum, why not? Q: They are passionate about what they like and don't care about the "important" things. A: Give them the opportunity of work about real life problems. Make them see the point of studying capitals of Europe, Physics or Mathematics. Q: I don't have time to learn about all the new software and hardware are coming out everyday. A: Your students do! give them the chance to use the tools they want to get where you want them to go. Q: Working the memory is very important. Don't tell me they don't have to learn the list of the kings. A: Completely agree. Memory is a skill we have to work in the school, but it can not be the only one. If maths teacher is working memory as science teacher, history teacher and language teacher, is not the memory a little bit over-trained? Q: MS Word corrects the misspellings of the students. A: What do you do when you find a word misspelled in a student notebook? Q: Underline it in red and tell the right way of doing it A: Same as Word! Anyway, you won't use only MS Word to write as you won't use the notebook to do so. Q: They don't listen to me! A: Maybe at the beginning they do, but we have been talking for years. There are many different ways of delivering content and many different ways to connect to different people (in your school and in the world) to  give variety to your lessons. Q: They are used to "right here, right now". A: Perfect! Upload your lessons to the cloud, they could access to them whenever and wherever they want. Q: They don't know any of the important things. A: I can't tell what is more important to know, the list of capitals of Europe or how to plan a trip to one of them. I can't tell, seriously. ]] English version | Version en espanol We did it! We love the way of thinking " Learning by doing" and keeping in this direction we have developed Julio Verne 2.0, our first Windows 8 application that you can download here. http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/2bc67eb5-a015-425c-a3d0-a7c6e0d9c112 In this app you can have a glimpse of our projects in the ICT department sorted by categories. A first step in this world which is going to be followed for many new apps to make our students get the most of this new way of working that Windows 8 offers to education. Here you have some shots.

I'm not and IT specialist, I just manage the IT department of my school, so I thought that it will be tough and very complicated. Nothing further from the truth The first thing I had to do was to follow a simple "clicks" path. Do you want to upgrade? Yes! In, no more than 10 minutes, all the process was finished and I found myself managing a professional Exchange, Lync and SharePoint site. The password issue Once you have migrated, Skydrive changes into a regular Live Service not managed anymore for the school, so you need two passwords to separate the services of Office365 and Skydrive. Every user of my school has to go to https://eduupgrade.office365.com and change his/her password. The new password will be used for Office365 More or less, it looks like this Login and services in live@edu Login and services of Office365 and Skydrive A little rock on the road Live@edu only managed and Exchange Service so it is what you find when you first go to Office365. There's no trace of Lync or SharePoint. After some questions in the forums, I realized that the license you got automatically is the A1 plan, which only includes the Exchange Service. What I did was to buy licenses of the A2 plan, which includes Lync and SharePoint. All my licences cost 0 , because the plan A2 is free for education. Then, just had to re-assign licenses to all my users and, voila!, Lync, Exchange and SharePoint free for my school. The world of DNS As I implemented live@edu in my school, I was used to manage DNS in my domain. A couple of new adjustments have to be done to make Lync and SharePoint work. A now... what? Well, the thing is that I'm a teacher, "just" a teacher. I mean, I'm not an IT specialist and I have in front of me such a professional tools as Lync or SharePoint to manage and implement in my school. But, guess what? I wish all my problems were like these ones. ]] Many devices can get into our classrooms nowadays, but depending on what you want get from your students and from the devices themselves you can use one or another. Here I show them in increasingly pedagogical potential Smartphone: Clearly they are not going to be the primary device for powerful learning, but they do allow for some basic level collaboration, communication, gathering of resources, and provide quick access to information. Internet search, dictionaries, twitting or shooting photos and videos are useful resources we can use in our lessons with just a phone. Today, almost everybody, is walking though life with powerful computers in their pockets, and, if your students have already know how to use them, why not take advantage from it? Slates: More powerful than mobiles, but in my point of view, there is not such a difference but the bigger screen. The level of collaboration is minimum and the control can teachers have over them are less than nothing. Almost same apps than mobiles and still reinforcing the isolation of individuals. But I have to say that, for some ages or disabilities are great. Storytelling for kindergarten, for example, or accessibility for certain disabilities are the perfect excuse to introduce these devices in our classrooms, but I can't see them none in primary or secondary school. For digital books are great as well, but they are still too expensive compering the investment to the possibilities they have. Laptops: The perfect device if you compare the price and the possibilities. They allow real multitasking, and serious creation. They allow the pulling of information from multiple sources simultaneously; manipulation of that information in many forms, and the creation of new knowledge and understandings. Tablet-PC What if you have the power of the apps in the slates and the multitasking and serious creation of the laptops in one device? I believe is the solution for education. You can have the individual variety of  the actual apps and the powerful learning possibilities of software. Now we've got an excuse to invest in digital textbooks, because, once you have work with them you can edit a presentation, share it or plug your usb to bring it somewhere else. You can print, get into a domain, control the access of your students, and with the digitized stylus make a real corrections of you lessons work. Until "yesterday" it was a dream. I believe (and I hope so) that Windows8 has many thing to say about this. The problem could be the price... keep your finger crossed. ]] As vice president of education for Microsoft Corp.s Worldwide Public Sector organization, Anthony Salcito works with education institutions and partners globally to embrace technology to optimize learning environments and student achievement.

In United States realized that there is a shortage of skilled workers in these areas so they had? to look for them beyond their country limits. Deep studies determined that these areas are isolated in the schools curriculum, instead of being integrated in every area. So, is our future heading to a STEM education? This infographic can give us a clue. ]] I have been reading the results of the ITL Research . A research made by Microsoft, UNESCO, INTEL, ... across 7 countries asking students, teachers and school leaders about how school is changing and moving towards the 21st century skills. Finland, Russia, Indonesia, Australia, UK, Mexico and Senegal The report is large but I'll just comment a few ideas that quickly came to mind mind while reading. "while ICT use in teaching is becoming more common, ICT use by students in their learning is still an exception" Teachers use technology but things didn't change that much with it. Of course we provided variety to our lessons and we are able to show videos, audio and animations which help students to understand better the concepts, but in principle is the same: we are talking and they are listening. Unless we extend our richer lessons beyond the classroom and our students can reach to the contents 24/7. These thing we couldn't do it before ICT in education. "even when the ICT are used by the students, the level of complexity of the uses is low and the tasks are  individual and used for personal improvement" Internet searches, report writing or practising routine skills don't give our students further knowledge. It is diffeent, which is good, but it is pretty much the same than we do before. The ITL research that these simple uses of the ICT in the lessons take the 79% of the uses, while the high level uses of the ICT, those that give our students skills to afford future works, are barely offered in a 20% of the cases. "21st century skills are not clearly defined, and there is no clear idea how to design associated learning activities" We are still teaching using a model that didn't change in the last 50 years; we are still preparing our students for works that don't exist. But the problem is that those skills that we are teaching are the easiest to evaluate. Routine task are very easy to assess. You know them or not. Project based learning, knowledge building or solving problems are not that easy. Students learn future skills when educators structure learning activities that require them. We have to trust that giving the skills we'll reach the contents with even more efficiency that using teachers based models. "using such a different countries in the researches we got consistent results and we realize that problems are basically the same everywhere" These results could be taken form every school in every country of the world no matter if it's public or private; if it's in a city or in a little village. What we need is to face this reality and try to develop skills and competences with the resources we have. "Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little." Edmond Burke Let me finish with antoher quote which gives the title of this post. It was said by Prof. Seymour Papert (1998) the father of educational computing: "My goal in life is to find ways in which children can use technology as a constructive medium to do things that they could not do before; to do things at a level of complexity that was not previously accessible to children ]] Ovi Barcelo (Spain, Microsoft certified trainer), Luis Fernandes (Portugal, Microsoft expert educator) and Joao Cunha (Portugal, Microsoft expert educator) have built a bilingual blog to help you choose the best applications for education available at Microsoft Store in Windows 8.

We all know that SharePoint is a professional environment and, sometimes, it is too "high level" to implement it in our school or lessons. With this template I have uploaded here, we can have a suitable environment ready to start our lessons. First of all, here is how it looks Classroom in SharePoint for Office365 Let's observe it closely. Document creation: Document creation On the upper right corner we have direct link to document creation. Using the Office Web-apps  our students can create easily Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, or a OneNote with a simple click. These documents are directly stored in "My documents" in this classroom. Links bar: Links bar There are three button on the left side of the page which must be personalized to make them useful. To do so, follow this simple steps. a) Go to Site Actions - View All Site Content-URL Settings (Under Lists) b) There you will find the three URL that need to be personalized. They are IM, Calendar and Outlook. c) Select an item and set it to point to where you want. NOTE: I didn't find necessary a link to point to IM, so this link (the one with the smile) I made it point to the main page of the site. Navigation bar: Navigation bar Automatically this template creates four sections which can be reached with its navigation bar. The sections are exactly what you need to start you classroom in a second. You can add more libraries or resources later; as many as you want. You can take a quick look at the last documents or posts in the different sections with the viewer at the bottom of the main page. Documents viewer: New documents viewer The sections are: Class materials : Two libraries where the common and the personal documents for this course can be stored Class Materials view Class wiki: Just a wiki where important concepts of the course can be created by the students or by the teachers. You can set, as a teacher, rules for it. Class Wiki view Class calendar : A common calendar for the whole group Class Calendar view Class discussions: A forum where, for example, questions or doubts can be solved by the community. Class Discussions view As we can see, with this template is very simple and quick to create a perfect virtual environment for your classroom. Installation process: First of all, obviously, download it here In the package you downloaded there are clear instructions about how to do it. I hope you fin it as useful as I have found it. ]] After watching this video one thought came to mind mind. What if  "We will no longer search for information and contents, they will find us via social media". I don't see it faraway from where we are right now. Students are recording their activity while they are surfing across different social media, and as the advertisement are changing depending on the webs they are visiting and the clicks that they are doing, the contents and information around their searches are changing depending on it. So, again, the information will look for us. Social media knows a lot about us, so, why this information will not be used to select what kind of information we want to know? But the question is: Where are we teachers in all this new environment? For me the answer is clear: In the school with our students, as always. What is changing (I believe it has already changed) is what are we doing there? If we are still the main source of information, we won't be outdated soon, we are already outdated! How can be compete against the information is in the Net? 10+1 tips to be a real 21st century (and beyond) teacher: Not all the information is found in the Internet is true. Help your students to be critical with the information they find. Is very pretentious to think that students will learn by their own. Motivate your students to learn and to build their own knowledge. The process is long. It is not only about getting information. Guide your students to the process of getting the information, processing it and assessing it, in order to get profit of it. Society today is practical. Focus your lessons in "Real-life" issues closer to your students. Play Probably this is the most difficult part, but assessment has to change. It will be a loss of time if we end it up with an regular exam. Assess the whole process of learning but not only the content . Listen to your students . They can help us to improve our methods. Update yourself . We all know how difficult is to be updated nowadays, but if we want to atlk their own language we have to know something about their world. Build knowledge relating different areas in your curriculum . Isolated subjects have less and less meaning these days. Social studies, languages or ICT skills, for example, are very difficult to forget while you want your students to do an Internet research. Be patient . Don't change the world in one day. Don't blame on the national standards, the lack of resources or your students behavior. As I said to my students. Take the plunge! Move one step ahead. It works ]] No chitchatting, let's get down to work A) Buy a domain and a hosting. There are many companies. I have my domain in 1and1. But this point is up to you. At this point you have finish the money investment during your LMS installation. B) Install a Moodle (1.9) in your domain. Now I will redirect the post to the official site where you can find the files and the best instructions. http://docs.moodle.org/19/en/Installing_Moodle C) Create a subdomain Depending on your hosting there are multiple options but they are mostly the same. Login into your host panel. Youll see the link domains Create a subdomain the the user interface. Youll find a button like create a subdomain or something like this Write the name of your subdomain. for example  edu.domain.com D) Start your live@edu campus Go to http://www.microsoft.com/liveatedu/enroll-and-deploy-process.aspx and click on the button "Enroll your school" at the upper right part of the screen. Click on the radio button Ready to enroll in the next screen. Step 1 of 2 . Fill the information required to identify your school. The most important part is the last field Domain Here you have to type the subdomain you would like to use in your live@edu mail address. For example, in this case the email addresses will be mary@edu.domain.com Step 2 of 2 . Fill the fields with the administrator information, password and ID E) Confirm ownership of the domain. This part could be a bit tricky if your are not familiar with domains and hostings. The easiest way is using an MX record. You will find the option in Alternative methods to prove domain ownership The MX record used to prove domain ownership must be in the exact format displayed when you are asked to prove ownership. For example, if your token is 0cbc8689f5394f86bc7b84983e30d3, specify the following: Target or Destination or Mail Server 0cbc8689f5394f86bc7b84983e30d3.msv1.invalid Priority 100 or Low Typically, DNS records that you create for new domains are detected quickly. Updates to the DNS records of existing domains may take longer to be detected. However, it should take no longer than 72 hours before the new record is detected. Until the new DNS record is detected, the Service Management Portal will display the message asking you to confirm domain ownership. To check if the DNS record has been detected, click Refresh. Detailed instructions for specific domain registrars Create DNS Records at 11 for Live@edu Create DNS Records at CentralNic for Live@edu Create DNS Records at eNom Central for Live@edu Create DNS Records at GoDaddy.com for Live@edu Create DNS Records at Network Solutions for Live@edu Create DNS Records at Register.com for Live@edu Create DNS Records at Yahoo! for Live@edu Create DNS Records using BIND for Live@edu Create DNS records using Windows-Based DNS for Live@edu Now click the refresh button in your admin page (Remember that it is in http://eduadmin.live.com ) your ownership will be confirmed. F) Create User Accounts After you set up a Live@edu domain and configure DNS to direct e-mail to it, you're ready to create user accounts. Each user account has its own Windows Live ID and a mailbox with 10 GB of storage. There are two ways to create user accounts with the Exchange Control Panel. Read on to decide which works best for you. Create accounts one at a time If you have to create a few test users or occasionally create a new user, use the Exchange Control Panel. To do this, sign in to the Exchange Control Panel, and select Manage My Organization Users Groups Mailboxes New. Create lots of user accounts If you have to create a lot of user accounts during initial user provisioning, you can use the Exchange Control Panel to import users using a CSV file. This is the easiest way to create lots of accounts. Again, sign in the Exchange Control Panel, and select Manage My Organization Users Groups Mailboxes Import users. Video: Exchange Online: How To: Bulk Import Users using a CSV file Watch this demo to learn how to import new users Here you can see an example of CSV file This table describes the attributes required to import new users. The import process will fail if any one of these attributes isn't included in the header row of the CSV import file. Note Type the attributes exactly as they are shown. Attributes can't contain spaces. They must be a single word. For example, First Name is invalid. You must use FirstName . Attribute Description Name Name specifies an identifier for the user. The value for Name must be unique in your domain. Important The value of Name is used as the display name in the list of mailboxes in the Exchange Control Panel and in the shared address book if you don't include the DisplayName attribute, which is an optional attribute. EmailAddress EmailAddress specifies the e-mail address of a new user. It is also used to create the corresponding Windows Live ID. The value of EmailAddress must be unique in your domain. FirstName FirstName specifies the user's first name. LastName LastName specifies the user's last name. Password Password is the initial password assigned to a new Windows Live ID that is created for a mailbox user. If you are a Live@edu organization, you can force users to change their password when they sign in to their account for the first time by using the ForceChangePassword attribute. Note The option to require users to change their password isn't available for Microsoft Office 365 e-mail organizations. Live@edu is set. A lot of features can be changed and personalized now, but with these steps you are ready to roll! G) Create users in Moodle You can use the same CSV file to import the users to Moodle, but with some changes. Copy and paste the CSVf file and your computer and change the name of the columns, like this. live@edu moodle Name username EmailAddress email FirstName firstname LastName lastname P assword password But a very important thing is to add 2 more columns in the CSV for Moodle. auth In this column you have to write liveid for all the users msn In this column you have to write the students live@edu mail address. H) Install the plugin in Moodle 1. Add the block live services to your moodle Download the plugin from its official site clicking on  Try it . Unzip it and upload it by FTP to your Moodle site. It will use many folders, but if you upload it directly with the distribution given in the .zip, all the files will be correctlly placed. This is how the folder looks: 2. Update moodle to recognise the block live id From the Moodle administration, click on "Notifications" The system will install the plugin automatically 3. Creating the app Now we have to login with our liveID into https://manage.dev.live.com/ to create an app Create new application (From  My apps  and  create application ) a) Give a name and set the language b) Our app has created a  Client ID  and a  Cliente Secret"  which well use later. c) Let's edit the app options so we need to go to  API settings  and edit, in  redirect domain  the URL of our Moodle site followed by /auth/liveid/webauth-handler.php 4. Configuring the block in moodle Now is the moment to activate all the work to make it run  in Moodle So we go to Users Authentication Manage authentication And show (clicking on the eye to open it) the option Windows Live ID  In the same screen, at the bottom we can add an html code to show an "liveID login box" in the login page of Moodle. It could be something like this. div style="font-size:120%" pspan style="font-family: 'Segoe UI Light', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 1.6em;color: #333333;"Utiliza tu img alt="Windows Live" height="23" longdesc="Windows Live Logo" src= http://yourdomain.com/blocks/live_services/shared/images/WindowsLive.png width="175" IDbr / para autenticarte en Moodle/spanspan style="font-family: 'Segoe Script', 'Felt Tip Roman', 'Comic Sans MS';font-size: 1.6em;color: #333333;" siempre!/span/p div style="line-height:32px" a href= http://yourdomain.com/auth/liveid/login.php style="background:transparent url( http://yourdomian.com/blocks/live_services/shared/images/glossybutton88.gif) no-repeat scroll top right;height: 32px;width:88px;display: block;float:left;margin-right: 0px;text-decoration: none;text-align:center;color: #333333;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;font-weight:normal;"span style="height: 32px;display: block;float:left;margin-right: 0px;text-decoration: none;color: #333333;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;font-weight:normal;line-height:12px;padding:9px 0px 11px 0px;background: transparent url( http://yourdomain.com/blocks/live_services/shared/images/glossybtn32.gif) no-repeat;; background-color: transparent"Entra/span/a /div 5. Set the secret key and application id to your Moodle Go to the options: Modules Blocks Microsoft Live Services a) Type the data of our app b) Mail and calendar. If you activate it your students will access to their mail and calendar with a simple click and without leaving the Moodle. In  Service Account  type the impersonation account (in the next step I will explain how to create an impersonation account ) of live@edu and its password and in the Outlook URL you should write the address of your inbox without the /owa part , not even the final /. b.1) Create an impersonation account. These kind of accounts allow the Outlook users to login into their mailboxes without typing again user and password and doing it from an external application Create in the control panel of live@edu ( http://domains.live.com ) an account like this impersonation@yourdomian.com Now run locally Windows PowerShell in administrator mode and type: $LiveCred = Get-Credential Login as live@edu administrator $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell/ -Credential $LiveCred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection Get into the users administration Import-PSSession $Session And finally New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name:EWSImpersonation -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:impersonation@yourdomain.com It will give permissions to impersonation . c) Messenger y Bing. If we want Bing and Messenger just activate both of them. About searching a couple of things: There are two buttons in the search bar The regular search in Bing. Typing and searching, Powerset Search . I didn't know it before. To use it, select a text and click on the button. The words highlighted will be searched in Bing. Note: The Java script in MS4M.zip is not working properly. I have fixed it  - search.js, here .- Just overwrite the file in http://yourdomain/blocks/live_services/services/search 7. Mesenger within the courses Set a   Sticky block  Just choose from the dropdown menu course page and the block Microsoft Live Services New " home-made " block I have programmed a HTML block to implement in moodle once you can access to it with your LiveID. With it, you can: Create a new document with just one click.

A: We can not expect from schools and students to forget about their "addiction" and to get back into a life where mobile phones don't exist and they were not part of our daily life. Q: Young people have a very active virtual social life. They spend more time working in their virtual friends than with the real social interaction. A: If they are spending so much time within a social network, is it not an important part of their life? If we expect a global education taking care about every student perspective, we can't forget about their life in the social networks, as we can not forget about sports, arts or social skills. Q: Students today the can't afford frustration. A: I have seen them trying and trying after a "Game Over" screen in a video game. We have thousand different ways of introducing video games in the curriculum, why not? Q: They are passionate about what they like and don't care about the "important" things. A: Give them the opportunity of work about real life problems. Make them see the point of studying capitals of Europe, Physics or Mathematics. Q: I don't have time to learn about all the new software and hardware are coming out everyday. A: Your students do! give them the chance to use the tools they want to get where you want them to go. Q: Working the memory is very important. Don't tell me they don't have to learn the list of the kings. A: Completely agree. Memory is a skill we have to work in the school, but it can not be the only one. If maths teacher is working memory as science teacher, history teacher and language teacher, is not the memory a little bit over-trained? Q: MS Word corrects the misspellings of the students. A: What do you do when you find a word misspelled in a student notebook? Q: Underline it in red and tell the right way of doing it A: Same as Word! Anyway, you won't use only MS Word to write as you won't use the notebook to do so. Q: They don't listen to me! A: Maybe at the beginning they do, but we have been talking for years. There are many different ways of delivering content and many different ways to connect to different people (in your school and in the world) to  give variety to your lessons. Q: They are used to "right here, right now". A: Perfect! Upload your lessons to the cloud, they could access to them whenever and wherever they want. Q: They don't know any of the important things. A: I can't tell what is more important to know, the list of capitals of Europe or how to plan a trip to one of them. I can't tell, seriously. ]] English version | Version en espanol We did it!

I'm not and IT specialist, I just manage the IT department of my school, so I thought that it will be tough and very complicated. Nothing further from the truth The first thing I had to do was to follow a simple "clicks" path. Do you want to upgrade? Yes! In, no more than 10 minutes, all the process was finished and I found myself managing a professional Exchange, Lync and SharePoint site. The password issue Once you have migrated, Skydrive changes into a regular Live Service not managed anymore for the school, so you need two passwords to separate the services of Office365 and Skydrive. Every user of my school has to go to https://eduupgrade.office365.com and change his/her password. The new password will be used for Office365 More or less, it looks like this Login and services in live@edu Login and services of Office365 and Skydrive A little rock on the road Live@edu only managed and Exchange Service so it is what you find when you first go to Office365. There's no trace of Lync or SharePoint. After some questions in the forums, I realized that the license you got automatically is the A1 plan, which only includes the Exchange Service. What I did was to buy licenses of the A2 plan, which includes Lync and SharePoint. All my licences cost 0 , because the plan A2 is free for education. Then, just had to re-assign licenses to all my users and, voila!, Lync, Exchange and SharePoint free for my school. The world of DNS As I implemented live@edu in my school, I was used to manage DNS in my domain. A couple of new adjustments have to be done to make Lync and SharePoint work. A now... what? Well, the thing is that I'm a teacher, "just" a teacher. I mean, I'm not an IT specialist and I have in front of me such a professional tools as Lync or SharePoint to manage and implement in my school. But, guess what? I wish all my problems were like these ones. ]] Many devices can get into our classrooms nowadays, but depending on what you want get from your students and from the devices themselves you can use one or another. Here I show them in increasingly pedagogical potential Smartphone: Clearly they are not going to be the primary device for powerful learning, but they do allow for some basic level collaboration, communication, gathering of resources, and provide quick access to information. Internet search, dictionaries, twitting or shooting photos and videos are useful resources we can use in our lessons with just a phone. Today, almost everybody, is walking though life with powerful computers in their pockets, and, if your students have already know how to use them, why not take advantage from it? Slates: More powerful than mobiles, but in my point of view, there is not such a difference but the bigger screen. The level of collaboration is minimum and the control can teachers have over them are less than nothing. Almost same apps than mobiles and still reinforcing the isolation of individuals. But I have to say that, for some ages or disabilities are great. Storytelling for kindergarten, for example, or accessibility for certain disabilities are the perfect excuse to introduce these devices in our classrooms, but I can't see them none in primary or secondary school. For digital books are great as well, but they are still too expensive compering the investment to the possibilities they have. Laptops: The perfect device if you compare the price and the possibilities. They allow real multitasking, and serious creation. They allow the pulling of information from multiple sources simultaneously; manipulation of that information in many forms, and the creation of new knowledge and understandings. Tablet-PC What if you have the power of the apps in the slates and the multitasking and serious creation of the laptops in one device? I believe is the solution for education. You can have the individual variety of  the actual apps and the powerful learning possibilities of software. Now we've got an excuse to invest in digital textbooks, because, once you have work with them you can edit a presentation, share it or plug your usb to bring it somewhere else. You can print, get into a domain, control the access of your students, and with the digitized stylus make a real corrections of you lessons work. Until "yesterday" it was a dream. I believe (and I hope so) that Windows8 has many thing to say about this. The problem could be the price... keep your finger crossed. ]] As vice president of education for Microsoft Corp.s Worldwide Public Sector organization, Anthony Salcito works with education institutions and partners globally to embrace technology to optimize learning environments and student achievement.

Es la unica forma de que los politicos tambien la conozcan, y actuen en consecuencia. Es una ley sencilla, no escrita en ningun tratado penal ni civil que Julian Tudor Hart , medico de familia britanico, describio con sencillez en un magistral articulo en la revista JAMA el ano 1971. La ley expone que la disponibilidad de buena asistencia sanitaria tiende a variar inversamente con las necesidades de salud de la poblacion atendida. Los que mas necesitan asistencia sanitaria reciben menos, los que necesitan menos reciben mas. La ley de cuidados inversos es mas patente en zonas donde la sanidad sigue las normas del libre mercado, zonas con poca asistencia publica y mucha privada. El ejemplo de Estados Unidos es el mas evidente, con millones de personas sin derecho a recibir asistencia sanitaria y otros tantos que solo reciben beneficencia. Nuestra situacion en Espana, con un sistema sanitario publico, no es ajena a la ley de cuidados inversos. Los medicos de zonas rurales tienen menos recursos tanto en los centros de salud como en los hospitales. En ocasiones las diferencias son tremendas. Esta asimetria rompe el principio de justicia e igualdad, uno de los pilares de nuestro ordenamiento juridico y del propio sistema sanitario. Imaginense que pasaria si se privatizara parte de la sanidad como se empenan en hacer desde la Consejeria de Sanidad de Madrid. Las diferencias aumentarian y se cumpliria de nuevo la ley de cuidados inversos. Los ancianos, enfermos complejos, los que padezcan problemas sociales o psiquiatricos recibirian menos recursos sanitarios. Les dejo unas ideas extraidas del articulo del doctor Tudor Hart y el link al texto completo. Es uno de los textos que todo profesional sanitario deberia saberse de memoria. Incluyo aqui a todos los gestores, tecnicos y politicos del ramo. La disponibilidad de una buena atencion medica tiende a variar inversamente con la necesidad de la poblacion atendida . Esta ley de atencion inversa funciona de forma mas completa donde la atencion medica esta mas expuesta a las fuerzas del mercado, y en menor medida en que dicha exposicion se reduce. La distribucion de libre mercado de la atencion medica es una forma social primitiva e historicamente obsoleta, su retorno implicaria  exagerar aun mas la mala distribucion de los recursos sanitarios. "C ualquier afirmacion de que el N.H.S. ha logrado su objetivo de ofrecer la igualdad en la atencion medica es una ilusion. De hecho, la igualdad absoluta nunca se podria lograr en cualquier sistema de atencion medica, educacion u otros servicios esenciales para la comunidad. Los motivos para sugerir lo contrario son politicos e ignoran los factores humanos." En las zonas con mas enfermedad y mortalidad los medicos generales tienen mas trabajo, las listas de espera son mas largas, hay menos apoyo del hospital, y heredan procesos clincios mas ineficaces que en las areas mas saludables, a su vez los medicos de hospitales cargan sobre sus hombros pesadas cargas con casos complejos que enfrentan con menos personal y equipo, edificios mas obsoletos, y crisis recurrentes en la disponibilidad de camas y personal de reemplazo. Estas tendencias se pueden resumir como la ley de cuidados inversos: l a disponibilidad de una buena atencion medica tiende a variar inversamente con la necesidad de la poblacion atendida. Hard laws: The inverse care law Citizens should know the inverse care law. It is the only way politicians also know it, and act accordingly. It is a simple law, not written in any criminal or civil treaty. Julian Tudor Hart, a retired  general practitioner, described it in a masterful article in JAMA in 1971. The law states that the availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the health needs of the population served. Those most in need receive less health care, which need less get more. The inverse care law is most evident in areas where health care follows the rules of the free market, areas with little public assistance and private facilities. The example of the United States is  obvious, with millions of people without the right to receive health care and others who only receive charities. Our situation in Spain, with a public health system, follows also the law of inverse care. Doctors in rural areas have fewer resources both in primary care clinics and hospitals. Sometimes the differences are tremendous. This asymmetry breaks the principle of justice and equality, one of the pillars of our legal system and the healthcare system. Imagine what would happen if privatized as part of health are determined to do from the Ministry of Health of Madrid. The differences increase fullfilling again the inverse care law. The elderly, the complex sick, those suffering social or psychiatric problems receive less health care resources. I copy some ideas from Dr Tudor Hart's article and the link to full text. It is one of the texts that every clinician should know by heart. I do the recomendation extensive to all managers, technicians and politicians from the health field. The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for the population served. This inverse care law operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced.  The market distribution of medical care is a primitive and historically outdated social form, and any return to it would further exaggerate the maldistribution of medical resources. The only sacrifice that would have to be made would be the concept of equality within the National Health Service . . . any claim that the N.H.S. has achieved its aim of providing equality in medical care is an illusion.  In fact, absolute equality could never be achieved under any system of medical care, education or other essential service to the community.  The motives for suggesting otherwise are political and ignore human factors. The pursuit of the very best for each patient who needs it remains an important force in the progress of care; a young person in renal failure may need a doctor who will fight for dialysis, or a grossly handicapped child one who will find the way to exactly the right department, and steer past the defeatists in the wrong ones.  But this pursuit must pay some regard to humane priorities, as it may not if the patient is a purchaser of medical care as a commodity.  The idealised, isolated doctor/patient relationship, that ignores the needs of other people and their claims on the doctors time and other scarce resources, is incomplete and distorts our view of medicine.  During the formative period of modern medicine this ideal situation could be realised only among the wealthy, or, in the special conditions of teaching hospitals, among those of the unprivileged with interesting diseases.  The ambition to practise this ideal medicine under ideal conditions still makes doctors all over the world leave those who need them most, and go to those who need them least, and it retards the development of national schools of thought and practice in medicine, genuinely based on the local content of medical care.  The ideal isolated doctor/patient relation has the same root as the 19th-century preoccupation with Robinson Crusoe as an economic elementary particle; both arise from a view of society that can perceive only a contractual relation between independent individuals.  The new and hopeful dimension in general practice is the recognition that the primary-care doctor interacts with individual members of a defined community.  Such a community-oriented doctor is not likely to encourage expensive excursions into the 21st century, since his position makes him aware, as few specialists can be, of the scale of demand at its point of origin, and will therefore be receptive to common-sense priorities.  It is this primary-care doctor who in our country initiates nearly every train of causation in the use of sophisticated medical care, and has some degree of control over what is done or not done at every point.  The commitment is a great deal less open-ended than many believe; we really do not prolong useless, painful, or demented lives on the scale sometimes imagined.  We tend to be more interested in the people who have diseases than in the diseases themselves, and that is the first requirement of reasonable economy and a humane scale of priorities. In areas with most sickness and death, general practitioners have more work, larger lists, less hospital support, and inherit more clinically ineffective traditions of consultation, than in the healthiest areas; and hospital doctors shoulder heavier case-loads with less staff and equipment, more obsolete buildings, and suffer recurrent crises in the availability of beds and replacement staff.  These trends can be summed up as the inverse care law: that the availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need of  the population served. ]] Los ciudadanos deben conocer la ley de cuidados inversos . Es la unica forma de que los politicos tambien la conozcan, y actuen en consecuencia. Es una ley sencilla, no escrita en ningun tratado penal ni civil que Julian Tudor Hart , medico de familia britanico, describio con sencillez en un magistral articulo en la revista JAMA el ano 1971. La ley expone que la disponibilidad de buena asistencia sanitaria tiende a variar inversamente con las necesidades de salud de la poblacion atendida. Los que mas necesitan asistencia sanitaria reciben menos, los que necesitan menos reciben mas. La ley de cuidados inversos es mas patente en zonas donde la sanidad sigue las normas del libre mercado, zonas con poca asistencia publica y mucha privada. El ejemplo de Estados Unidos es el mas evidente, con millones de personas sin derecho a recibir asistencia sanitaria y otros tantos que solo reciben beneficencia. Nuestra situacion en Espana, con un sistema sanitario publico, no es ajena a la ley de cuidados inversos. Los medicos de zonas rurales tienen menos recursos tanto en los centros de salud como en los hospitales. En ocasiones las diferencias son tremendas. Esta asimetria rompe el principio de justicia e igualdad, uno de los pilares de nuestro ordenamiento juridico y del propio sistema sanitario. Imaginense que pasaria si se privatizara parte de la sanidad como se empenan en hacer desde la Consejeria de Sanidad de Madrid. Las diferencias aumentarian y se cumpliria de nuevo la ley de cuidados inversos. Los ancianos, enfermos complejos, los que padezcan problemas sociales o psiquiatricos recibirian menos recursos sanitarios. Les dejo unas ideas extraidas del articulo del doctor Tudor Hart y el link al texto completo. Es uno de los textos que todo profesional sanitario deberia saberse de memoria. Incluyo aqui a todos los gestores, tecnicos y politicos del ramo. La disponibilidad de una buena atencion medica tiende a variar inversamente con la necesidad de la poblacion atendida . Esta ley de atencion inversa funciona de forma mas completa donde la atencion medica esta mas expuesta a las fuerzas del mercado, y en menor medida en que dicha exposicion se reduce. La distribucion de libre mercado de la atencion medica es una forma social primitiva e historicamente obsoleta, su retorno implicaria  exagerar aun mas la mala distribucion de los recursos sanitarios. "C ualquier afirmacion de que el N.H.S. ha logrado su objetivo de ofrecer la igualdad en la atencion medica es una ilusion. De hecho, la igualdad absoluta nunca se podria lograr en cualquier sistema de atencion medica, educacion u otros servicios esenciales para la comunidad. Los motivos para sugerir lo contrario son politicos e ignoran los factores humanos." En las zonas con mas enfermedad y mortalidad los medicos generales tienen mas trabajo, las listas de espera son mas largas, hay menos apoyo del hospital, y heredan procesos clincios mas ineficaces que en las areas mas saludables, a su vez los medicos de hospitales cargan sobre sus hombros pesadas cargas con casos complejos que enfrentan con menos personal y equipo, edificios mas obsoletos, y crisis recurrentes en la disponibilidad de camas y personal de reemplazo. Estas tendencias se pueden resumir como la ley de cuidados inversos: l a disponibilidad de una buena atencion medica tiende a variar inversamente con la necesidad de la poblacion atendida. Hard laws: The inverse care law Citizens should know the inverse care law. It is the only way politicians also know it, and act accordingly. It is a simple law, not written in any criminal or civil treaty. Julian Tudor Hart, a retired  general practitioner, described it in a masterful article in JAMA in 1971. The law states that the availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the health needs of the population served. Those most in need receive less health care, which need less get more. The inverse care law is most evident in areas where health care follows the rules of the free market, areas with little public assistance and private facilities. The example of the United States is  obvious, with millions of people without the right to receive health care and others who only receive charities. Our situation in Spain, with a public health system, follows also the law of inverse care. Doctors in rural areas have fewer resources both in primary care clinics and hospitals. Sometimes the differences are tremendous. This asymmetry breaks the principle of justice and equality, one of the pillars of our legal system and the healthcare system. Imagine what would happen if privatized as part of health are determined to do from the Ministry of Health of Madrid. The differences increase fullfilling again the inverse care law. The elderly, the complex sick, those suffering social or psychiatric problems receive less health care resources. I copy some ideas from Dr Tudor Hart's article and the link to full text. It is one of the texts that every clinician should know by heart. I do the recomendation extensive to all managers, technicians and politicians from the health field. The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for the population served. This inverse care law operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced.  The market distribution of medical care is a primitive and historically outdated social form, and any return to it would further exaggerate the maldistribution of medical resources. The only sacrifice that would have to be made would be the concept of equality within the National Health Service . . . any claim that the N.H.S. has achieved its aim of providing equality in medical care is an illusion.  In fact, absolute equality could never be achieved under any system of medical care, education or other essential service to the community.  The motives for suggesting otherwise are political and ignore human factors. The pursuit of the very best for each patient who needs it remains an important force in the progress of care; a young person in renal failure may need a doctor who will fight for dialysis, or a grossly handicapped child one who will find the way to exactly the right department, and steer past the defeatists in the wrong ones.

Social media hoaxes: Could machine-learning algorithms help debunk Twitter rumors before they spread? ... In a new paper, to be published in the journal Internet Research next month, the authors of the Chile earthquake studyCarlos Castillo, Marcelo Mendoza, and Barbara Pobletetest out their algorithm on fresh data sets and find that it works pretty well. According to Meier, their machine-learning classifier had an AUC, or area under the curve, of 0.86. That means that, when presented with a random false tweet and a random true tweet, it would assess the true tweet as more credible 86 percent of the time. (An AUC of 1 is perfect; an AUC of 0.5 is no better than random chance.) My guess is that a knowledgeable and experienced human Twitter user could do better than that under most circumstances. And of course, if a given algorithm became widespread, committed trolls like the Hurricane Sandy villain @ComfortablySmug could find ways to game it. Still, an algorithm has the potential to work much faster than a human, and as it improves, it could evolve into an invaluable "first opinion" for flagging news items on Twitter that might not be true. ...

A big problem with theories floated on social media is that information can go viral simply because it is popular, whether or not it is true. Patrick Meier of the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) in Doha is building Verily, a system that allows users to submit verification requests for information they are interested in. Each request prompts a crowd of online workers to set off into their networks to figure it out. The system gathers evidence for and against the claim, though it won't pass judgement. ...By training machine learning algorithms on huge data sets, Meier is building up profiles of the classes of digital evidence that tend to be credible, and those that are not. As an example, Meier points to a recent study of misinformation on Twitter after the 2010 Chilean earthquake. Carlos Castillo of the QCRI and colleagues showed that non-credible tweets tend to spark responses that question or rebuke them  a trait software can be trained to recognise. "Non-credible information propagates across the twittersphere leaving very specific ripples behind," says Meier.

These tools allow editors and media managers to react to shifts in their audiences interest, but what is lacking is a tool to help predict such shifts. Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) and Al Jazeera are announcing the launch of FAST (Forecast and Analytics of Social Media and Traffic), a platform that analyses in real-time the life cycle of news stories on the web and social media, and provides predictive analytics that gauge audience interest. The explosion of big data in the media domain has provided QCRI an excellent research opportunity to develop an innovative way to derive value from the information, said Dr Ahmed Elmagarmid, Executive Director of QCRI. Together with our valued partner, Al Jazeera, the QCRI team has developed a platform that will help shift the way media does business. Al Jazeera Englishs website thrives on good original content in news and features, dynamic ways of creativity through interactive and crowd sourcing methods, and up-to-date social media tools. We welcome working with QCRI in developing FAST as it allows us to understand the consumption of news and what is expected to do well in driving traffic forward. Analytics in predicting the future trend of a web story is a crucial component in understanding web traffic, this initiative is a component we welcome, said Imad Musa, Head of Online for Al Jazeera English.

This book starts with a detailed description of well-established diffusion models, including the independent cascade model and the linear threshold model, that have been successful at explaining propagation phenomena. We describe their properties as well as numerous extensions to them, introducing aspects such as competition, budget, and time-criticality, among many others. We delve deep into the key problem of influence maximization, which selects key individuals to activate in order to influence a large fraction of a network. Influence maximization in classic diffusion models including both the independent cascade and the linear threshold models is computationally intractable, more precisely #P-hard, and we describe several approximation algorithms and scalable heuristics that have been proposed in the literature. Finally, we also deal with key issues that need to be tackled in order to turn this research into practice, such as learning the strength with which individuals in a network influence each other, as well as the practical aspects of this research including the availability of datasets and software tools for facilitating research. We conclude with a discussion of various research problems that remain open, both from a technical perspective and from the viewpoint of transferring the results of research into industry strength applications The book is available for USD 20 or through many libraries: Wei Chen, Laks V.S.

He held his hand up to the camera, showing what he'd written on his palm: "One World." Then he urged viewers to respond. The video was just 41 seconds long, but it caught people's imagination. Within a few days, hundreds of YouTube users had posted videosshot on webcams, usually in their bedroomsdisplaying their own scrawled messages: "Don't quit!" "Tread gently." "Think." "Carpe diem." "Open your eyes." And my favorite, "They could be gone tomorrow!" Soon, MadV had inspired 2,000 replies , making it the most-responded-to video in YouTube's history.

The electoral votes obtained in 2008 and in 2012. The % of popular and electoral vote. The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) Data for 2008 Elections was obtained from Wikipedia . Data for 2012 Elections was obtained from politico.com . Please note that I do not fully understand most of the subtleties of the electoral college so the number of electoral votes may be not accurate. Nevertheless, this "groundhog-day" baseline is really good (for the US Presidential Elections): it only missed 2 out of 51 states with an impressive MAE of 2.75% . So, in short, what would be a reasonable MAE for an algorithm to be credible (to me)? A 5% improvement over the baseline, i.e. MAE = 2.61%. Of course, if your algorithm is able to be below a MAE of 2.48% (a 10% improvement) I would be impressed. If your MAE is greater than 2.61%, I'm really sorry but your algorithm is useless :( However, I think that any sensible prediction should take into account data from past elections and, therefore, it would be really difficult to tell the difference between just using the baseline and "icing" that historical data with some extra information from social media.

On the other hand, using a Hangout On Air I would be able of streaming the conference through YouTube and anyone interested in it could attend the lecture without joining the Hangout. Moreover, the video would be immediately available after the broadcasting. Hence, I prepared my list of "requirements": I wanted to share my screen using Skype and Google+ Hangouts. The screen should show both my slides and my webcam. I didn't want to pay for Skype premium. The solution was to prepare a webpage showing the "slides" (actually images produced from PowerPoint) and the webcam.

Update August 15: I was wrong when saying that DiGrazia et al. should have cited Morstatter et al. I warned them on April 25 about that paper but by then they should have already submitted to ASA 2013 and, therefore, their final paper could not have made reference to the work by Morstatter. Prior warnings : This is a lenghty post, I'm sorry. I've done my best to structure it properly but it touches plenty of intermingled topics and, besides, it has been written in a hush (paraphrasing Pascal, if I had more time, I would have written a shorter post). I hope none of the people mentioned here will have hard feelings because of this post; you know, it's just academia, nothing personal. The tone is sometimes humorous (or sarcastic depending on your inclination). The post tackles with the following topics: (1) a comment about the paper that DiGrazia et al. presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association in New York on August 2013; (2) some personal digressions on the use of "catchy" titles in academic papers and the possible unintended outcomes of such practice; (3) more personal digressions on press releases and handling the press when covering academic research; and (4) a comment to the open editorial published by Fabio Rojas in Washington Post tangentially related to the paper mentioned in (1). Said that, let's the post begin! In case you don't know my work I've earned kind of a reputation as someone that tend to criticize anyone claiming they has been able to predict elections using Twitter data ( i , ii , iii , iv and v ). There is a long and twisted story behind that reputation but, at this moment, let's reduce my role to that cliche: my only line is "No, you cannot predict elections with Twitter" . To clarify that point a little, up to now, nobody has tried to predict elections using Twitter data (except for this person and this people ), everybody has shown that they could have predicted elections. In other words, researchers have collected tweets related to a given election, they have applied to them some method and after the election they have compared their results with the actual outcome and said eureka! Hence, one of the facets of my role in this academic "drama" is that I ask researchers to predict elections before they are held. It seems pretty simple, right? Nevertheless, virtually every paper published up to now is a post-facto prediction which, obviously, cast doubts on such results; not only because authors can inadvertently incur in data dredging but also because those authors not achieving positive results are not publishing their papers and, hence, the public perceives that predictions are possible when they may not. I think such a requirement is sensible for a so-called prediction but anyway it is mostly ignored and some authors argue that their paper is not actually dealing with predictions to skip such a requisite (BTW, in Twitter conversation this argument has been used by one of the authors of the DiGrazia et al. paper but they are not the only ones). However, just in case someone is paying attention: You, Have, To, Predict, In, Advance. If you don't want to follow my advice follow that of Lewis-Beck (2005): "the forecast must be made before the event. The farther in advance [...] the better" . Once clarified my position (you cannot predict) and the worst sin of virtually every paper on predicting elections from Twitter (they make postdictions and not predictions) what's the matter with the work by DiGrazia et al.? Why should I comment it appart of fulfilling my role of Jiminy Cricket? There are a number of reasons for doing it. First, it is a nice paper, with issues as any other paper; however, if such issues could be somewhat solved or reduced, it provides evidence for the hypothesis most of us were working on without even cast a doubt on it; namely, that Twitter actually provides insight (in some distant way) to the position of the public regarding elections. Second, it is a perfect example of how a team of researchers can be involved through misfiring catching titles and unfortunate press releases in an uncomfortable position while trying to balance what they paper really says with what they seemed to have said to some journalist and, hence, the public believes is scientific evidence. It must be said however, that in this case most of the harm is due IMHO to the title of the press release (not the fault of the authors of the paper) and one unfortunate open editorial authored by only one of the authors. In fact, this op-ed is the third reason to discuss the paper. That op-ed promises a lot on the basis of really thin evidence but cites anyway parts of the paper for support, therefore confusing the public by mixing personal opinions with biased excerpts of scientific evidence. From my point of view this op-ed is the most interesting aspect of this story since it's the first time I cannot point a journalist for having misinterpreted a researcher but it is the researcher himself the one "twisting" his work to picture their opinions in a much more attractive light. The paper of interest is "More Tweets, More Votes: Social Media as a Quantitative Indicator of Political Behavior" by Joseph DiGrazia, Karissa McKelvey, Johan Bollen and Fabio Rojas. As aforementioned, the paper was presented at ASA 2013 and you can find a draft of the paper (slightly different from the final version) here . For the final version please ask the authors since the copy I have got was sent to me from someone, not the authors, and haven't found it online. However, before proceeding with my review of the paper I would like to explain how I came to it. Quite simple, I was curious because of the title; in fact, I was curious because the first part of the title: "More Tweets, More Votes" . If you are a connoisseur of academia you know that attention is everything; attention get you cites, coworkers, program committees, etc. You know the proverb, if a paper is written and nobody reads it, does it make any impact? Hence, authors try to get the attention of potential readers from the very beginning, that is, the abstract is important but the title is key. This paper has a really catchy title; indeed, catch and clever since it serves as an abstract, it's memorable and nicely fits a tweet. This paper has got a title which is a "winner". Because of the title I supposed that the authors were using the most simple approach to predict elections: that is, counting the number of tweets for a candidate, take them as votes, compute the vote share, et voila! From that supposition I read the paper (around April) and found it rather different from my initial guess. While wearing my referee hat I found it to have some flaws but with also with potential. The title, however, was a problem: it promised much more than the paper provided and I guessed it was going to be a headline attractor (as it has been). Please do not misunderstand me: I'm a great fan of catchy titles for academic papers. I could be very capable to introduce myself a-la Troy McClure: Hi, I'm Dani Gayo. You may remember be from such papers as "I wanted to predict elections with Twitter and all I got was this lousy paper" or "All liaisons are dangerous when all your friends are known to us" . (BTW, both are real papers by me). The problem with catchy titles is that the paper has to be able to stand for the title. With this paper you have a feeling not entirely unlike what you have after reading "The Neverending Story" : it's nice, but it does not fulfill the title. Before you forget this post to read the paper I'll provide an spoiler : the authors looked for a correlation between number of tweets for a candidate and the margin of difference between that candidate and his or her opponent. They found the correlation to be significant and positive which means that, in general, the larger the number of tweets the larger the difference in votes you should expect. Unfortunately, the truth is that you cannot readily apply that finding as a rule of thumb to compute the expected vote rate or vote difference from the tweets. That's why the paper does not stand for the catchy title. Is that a sin? No way, in fact it was, at least for me, a glad surprise and, indeed, the final version of the paper is quite interesting. Nevertheless, the title is far more sexy than the paper but I'm repeating myself. In the final version of the paper the authors made a great effort to control for any confounding variable such as incumbency, demographic features and so on. The good news is that when controlling for all of those variables the correlation is still significant, the not-so-good news (my point of view) is that the correlation between tweets and votes is really small when compared with other factors (such as incumbency, for instance). As a researcher I'm reasonably excited with the good news: it means that Twitter is no inane chatter, tweets tend to generally serve as a proxy for public opinion. The problem lies in the not-so-god news: it means it is really hard to make any sensible prediction and, let's not forget, we humans want to predict the future and not simply to know that it is predictable in theory. What's the reason why sometimes tweets can reflect the actual vote and sometimes not? I think a plausible explanation is that the Twittersphere is far from monolithic and that depending on the candidate, even on the topic, one tribe or another is going to dominate the Twitter space and you will never know which tribe is responding. You can find much more on this somewhat devastating report from Pew Research . Those are the main worrisome aspects of a paper that is perfectly nice but promises a lot to then fail the reader by not fulfilling its promises. Needless to say, in addition to that, I have the common petty comments any referee would provide (please note that many of these refer to the first draft of the paper, BTW, I exchange some comments with one of the authors, Fabio, and this makes writing this post much more complicated for me from a personal point of view): The paper does not completely cover the prior art which, at this moment, is still reasonably small to be cited with detail. The following material could provide complete references to that prior art: [1] , [2] . Much more detail should be provided regarding the dataset, specially the way in which tweets related to a candidate where obtained (keywords used and date ranges), and how topicality was warranted. Since the paper has been published after the work by Morstatter et al. (2013) the authors should at least acknowledge that the representativeness of their sample is unknown (since they have not used the Firehose). Indeed, the problem of not having access to the Firehose and try to justify the gardenhose as a representative sample is a bummer for all of us from now on. A clarification on this rectification can be found here . The authors take into account both positive and negative tweets under the argument that "all publicity is good publicity" , is a really weak argument and there have been a number of papers showing that tweet-counting is a subpar approach. In the final version of the paper the authors mentioned the Pollyanna effect which, in total honesty, I do not think has been properly interpreted by them to support their argumentation. In other words, there are no actual argumentation to support that negative tweets are a good thing for a candidate. In the first draft there are a couple of scatter plots that, in my opinion, if anything they only help to prove my point (i.e. that the number of tweets does not actually mean anything for a given concrete candidate). In this regard I'm pointing to this post in The Monkey Cage that makes a much better job than me explaining the problems with that scatter plot and the interpretation the authors made of it. In addition to that, performance in electoral prediction cannot be evaluated by telling how many elections one has correctly guessed (even when discussing a highly polarized system with only two major parties like the US). It's much more important to know the share vote, specially in disputed elections and/or systems with more than two parties (e.g. most of Europe and other countries in the world). Again, it's not me who says this but Campbell (2004). Finally, my common warnings about Twitter user base not being representative of the population, self-selection bias, spam, propaganda, lack of geolocation of tweets, etc. apply to this paper. So, in short, the paper is nice, it's a honest approach to the problem with some new ideas. If everything in the dataset is right , and this can be replicated with other comparable datasets, and/or data from other countries, and/or data with better preprocessing (eliminating bots and spam for instance), then their results would be of interest for researchers since it would imply that Twitter data means something (although we worked on that basis all of the time). Unfortunately, the results are no ground breaking and, no, given a race more tweets does not imply always more votes, it's much more complicated than that. That for the paper. Let's talk about the press release. As I said before, the paper had a press release issued by the American Sociological Association which you can find here . I don't know how usual or unusual it is that ASA issues a press release for an article in a conference but it certainly helped to spread the word about the paper making a subtle twist to its main conclusion. The press release was issued with the following title: "Study finds more tweets mean more votes for political candidates" . If you are not used to press releases by research organizations I'll tell you; they are interested in what I call "sexy research". Cures for cancer or AIDS apply for sexy research, "striking" or "bizarre" results are also sexy research, social media is currently sexy research in computer science (famous for being unsexy, unless you work in computer graphics or robots). Having had my fair deal of interviews with journalists and issuing press releases I think I know a little about them. First, press releases (and articles about science) are usually written in a rush, they must be brief, they must be catchy, they must be to the point, and they must show that the research is useful for the public (aka the tax payers, aka your funding source). If you read the press release regarding this paper you can find that it describes the main findings of the paper but from a rather optimistic point of view. This applies not only to this press release but to any press release regarding a piece of research. It is somewhat comparable to listing a house, you don't say "small", you say "cute"; you don't say "falling apart", you say "great potential"; you don't say "old", you say "with character". All of this make up is usually done by the people in the press office who know that we, researchers/scientists, are "too shy to sell our work"; they are there to simplify our explanations, make them more mundane, more close to the public... If you compare the writing of the release with the quotes from the authors you can see that the authors are much rather cautious in their statements. This is also common since we, researchers, do not like to make bold statements (except in catchy titles) and usually this quotations are obtained by the people in the press office by making questions (which are trying to obtain a catchy claiming in line with their prejudgment of the piece of research). If you have gone through this you probably understand the nightmare it is, the jokes from your colleagues once the press release is issued, the rants in the comments in the online newspaper... If you haven't you are lucky (lucky but with unsexy research, sorry). Now, let's suppose you are a journalist going through a number of press releases. What would you think of this one? "Wow, Twitter can predict elections!" By now the snowball is rolling and, therefore, the paper is covered in plenty of newspapers without even contacting the authors most of the time, they will publish the press release almost verbatim and the mantra "Twitter can predict elections" is again on track... At this moment, I should enter scene and do my routine. However, this time was different (I had hoped): (1) I had already tell the authors my point of view, (2) I'm really tired of telling once and again what I see as obvious (that predicting elections is NOT that easy) and, (3) there is no point in trolling thousands of journalist worldwide plus hundreds of thousands of tweeters wowing "Hey, Twitter can predict elections" (BTW, I have not ever trolled journalists). Nope, I'm water my friend, I'm flowing... I was flowing until I reached an open-editorial by Fabio Rojas, one of the co-authors of the paper, published in Washington Post and titled "How Twitter can help predict an election" . After reading it I simply got frozen. I got frozen because I profoundly disagree with that piece, not actually because of the content but because of the unfortunate timing and (mis)use of a piece of research to support personal opinions about a future that may simply not occur. I also got frozen because I had a gentle exchange of e-mails with Fabio regarding their paper and I'm not a bully nor a troll. Hence, Fabio, this is no personal, just business. As I see it the op-ed is a piece of opinion about a plausible (albeit rather distant) future usage of social media. If it simply was that, I would not have any problem with it but Fabio cites the paper where he's coauthor to provide support for those opinions and, in fact, although some facts are extracted from the paper, the paper as a whole does not provide any evidence to support the claims in the op-ed. Those facts taken from the paper are provided without context and cherry-picked so the reader (the public, the tax payers, the source of funding) are mislead to think that performance is much better than it really is and that predictions are easy to made. The terrible "all publicity is good publicity" mantra is used again. The problem with that is that virtually every reader can think of counterexamples against that line of argumentation and, hence, put the author (and the research he undertakes) under a poor light. It is because of all this that I think that this op-ed has been unfortunate at least and potentially harmful for the field of computational social science in general and electoral prediction based on user generated content in particular. Finally, if you have reached the end of this post you may wonder what's my opinion on this matter. Can or cannot elections be predicted from Twitter data? If you aim to use the methods reported in the literature up to now, no, you cannot. However, I'm mildly optimistic and more work is needed (specially regarding adversarial scenarios, i.e. those where candidates are aware that Twitter data can be used to measure their potential). Needless to say, "I dunno, we need more work" is not sexy and does not make headlines. To conclude, I'd like to provide a short summary for all of the topics I covered in this post: I rather liked the paper by DiGrazia et al. It has issues but which paper hasn't. The title is sexy and otherwise I would not have read it so, although problematic, it was an overall good decision. Use catchy titles with caution. Think of them attached to your resume before using them. Think of potential consequences, specially when read by press offices and journalists. Be extremely cautious when writing a press release or working with people from the press office to issue one. Be sure they do not distort your work. The op-ed by Fabio was, from my point of view, a misfortunate event because of timing and because of mixing personal opinion with cherry-picked scientific evidence. It is hard for the non expert telling apart a scientist's opinions from hard facts, everything is "scientists say". Hence, when writing for the general public be even more cautious and always be clear and make distinction between facts accepted by the whole community, findings in your work (which may be disputed by other authors) and your personal opinions (driven or not by your findings).

Unless you read that one before, you'll probably won't get the point of this one. In my previous post I said that one of the issues with the DiGrazia et al. (2013) paper is that they did not mention the work by Morstatter et al. (2013). The later work is crucial because it shows that when using the public Streaming API gardenhose (i.e. the randomly sampled 1% stream of tweets that most researchers use) results are quite different from those obtained when using the firehose (the whole stream of tweets). In my previous post I said that DiGrazia et al. should have at least acknowledged that they didn't known how representative their data was on the basis of the work by Morstatter et al. [ Addendum, August 18: However, as Alex Hanna accurately pointed out , this would not exactly apply to the study by DiGrazia et al. since they used the gardenhose (10% sample) and not the 1% public Streaming API.] To justify that I simply said that the work by Morstatter et al. preceded that by DiGrazia et al. However, Emilio Ferrara told me that I was wrong on that since the work by Morstatter et al. was published in July and the first draft by DiGrazia et al. was published in February. I was sure, however, that DiGrazia et al. were aware of that work because I had addressed them to a preprint on April 25. That was the reason for me still pointing that flaw in the paper. However, I was not aware of the deadlines for the annual meeting of the ASA: on January 9, 2013 papers should have been submitted, and March 18, 2013 was the date decisions letters should be sent to authors. Besides, on April 30, 2013 the final program for the conference was to be announced so I assume that between late March and early April authors should have submitted their camera ready version of the paper. So, in short. The work by Morstatter et al. was available online at least on April 25 and DiGrazia et al. should know of it at least from that date because of my e-mail. However, it's very likely that by that day they had already submitted their camera ready version of the paper and, hence, that would explain the lack of that reference in their paper. [Addendum August 18] Besides, as aforementioned, it's debatable whether the findings by Morstatter et al. when comparing the public Streaming API with the firehose could apply or not to the gardenhose employed by DiGrazia et al. Because of this I have striken through that concrete piece of criticism in my previous post. Nevertheless, the findings by Morstatter et al. are a source of concern for all of us working with Twitter public Streaming API (the 1% sample) and even maybe those working with the gardenhose (the 10% sample) since we simply don't know the biases they can exhibit when compared with the whole firehose.]] "Jonathon Fletcher: forgotten father of the search engine". The article is quite interesting since it vindicates one pioneer of the now essential field of Web-IR (Web Information Retrieval) but it has a number of "flaws" that I, as an academic, would like to elaborate. Certainly, the work by Fletcher describing his search engine is very little known ( 4 cites [1], according to Google Scholar). Maybe one reason for this is that his original paper vanished with his homepage at the University of Stirling. Fortunately, we have the Internet Archive so you can read it . Another reason for Fletcher work to remain mostly unnoticed is that his search engine (Jumpstation) only operated from December 1993 to April 1994. In other words, it was a proof of concept rather than a full-fledge system. Finally, Fletcher was not the only one making search engines around 1993-1994. As I like to say "It steam-engines when it's steam-engine-time": just in WWW94 (aka The First International Conference on the World-Wide-Web) nine papers about Web indexing and Web-IR were presented. Needless to say, they did not call it Web-IR at the time. Martijn Koster , Oliver A. McBryan , Pinkerton or Mauldin Leavitt were some of the researchers that were working in the same problem that Fletcher did and producing virtually the same architecture: that is, a robot to crawl the Web, in order to feed a database that was, in turn, indexed to be eventually queried by users of the search engine. So, is Fletcher the parent of the search engine? Not really. Who is then? None of the aforementioned researchers or, better, all of them! That's why I much prefer talking about pioneers in a field than about "parents". I highly encourage you to read all of their papers, specially if you are pursuing a PhD in CS or if you are still an undergraduate in CS. After reading those papers you'll feel that it's something you could do in a couple of days, maybe a week. The systems they describe are crude, simplistic and primitive. However, the architecture behind those toys has been powering the search engine industry for the last 20 years. That's what I call an influential idea and that's why those papers are relevant and highly cited. The BBC piece obviously talks about Google as a counterpoint to Fletcher's story. You know, you have this guy who invented something great but some other people get all the credit (and the money). Unfortunately, there are other stories from the early search engine pioneers. Indeed, some of the aforementioned researchers got some credit (and probably some money too). For instance, Pinkerton created WebCrawler that was sold to America Online and then Excite. And if you are old enough you must remember Lycos, right? Well, it was the product of Mauldin Leavitt. I would like to talk also about the impact of the work by Brin Page (Google), the way in which they were virtually forced to found a company to monetize their idea, and the way in which all this search engine industry is in debt with IBM in 1950s but that will be another post. As usual you can find me at Twitter: @PFCdgayo . [1] Although not appearing in the citations to Fletcher's work I mentioned him as a search engine pioneer in my PhD dissertation (2005). ]] previous post I argued that there is no single parent of Web search engines but, instead, a number of pioneers that worked unaware of each other and eventually produced virtually identical achitectures. Nevertheless, the researchers I surveyed in that post pioneered the first age of search engines; that is, the now (literally or de facto) defunct Altavista, Lycos or Excite. Google, in contrast, is an example of the second age of search engines to which Bing, Yandex or Baidu also belong. It's not my aim to provide a lengthy explanation of the differences between Google (and family) and prior search engines since, first of all, Google is today very different from Google in 1998. Instead, what I'll try to do is to briefly explain why the idea by Brin Page was both brilliant and it has had an enormous impact. To start with, it's extremely difficult to explain in words how broken Web searching was back in 1997. If you are old enough (i.e. you were a user of Altavista or Lycos or Excite) you surely remember it. If you are not that old (i.e. Google has been your search engine since you can remember) I'll provide you a couple of examples (taken from the original Brin Page papers). First example: most major search engines of the time were unable to find themselves. That is, the first result you obtained when issuing the query "excite" in Excite, or "altavista" in Altavista was quite unlikely to be www.excite.com or www.altavista.com. Second example: when submitting the query "bill clinton" (you know, the husband of Hillary Clinton, the POTUS at the time) a major search engine produced as one top result a webpage like this one . So, we had search engines incapable to find themselves and that, at the same time, ignored that maybe www.whitehouse.gov was a better result for "bill clinton" than a crappy page mocking on him. What was the problem with those search engines? The short explanation is that they were trying to apply Information Retrieval to the Web. That had plenty of sense since, at the time, IR was very mature. In fact, the discipline was almost 40 years old and, therefore, all that know-how should apply nicely to the Web. Unfortunately, it simply did not work. Hence, Web search engines devoted tons of energy to refine their respective "secret sauces" (I mean, ranking algorithms). Those "sauces" involved exploiting features from webpages ranging from size, to usage of headings, appearance of keywords in links, headings and other parts of the page, etc. Needless to say, secret sauces improved little (if anything at all). So, again, what was the problem with mid-1990s search engines? I hate to repeat myself but it was applying IR to the Web because, unfortunately, the Web is not a text collection. As Marchiori said , the Web is not made of text documents but of hypertext documents and, therefore, search engines should focus not on the textual features but in the "hyper" features. Indeed, Marchiori suggested that webpages should be ranked on the basis the links they received and the rankings of the pages linking to them while mostly obviating the textual content. Such an idea sounds crazy but it's simply mindblowing. Unfortunately, no matter the greatness of this idea Marchiori is not the parent of the modern search engine since he stated that such an approach was unfeasible in practice. If you are a PhD student (or even a grown-up researcher) you should learn something from that: don't, make, bold, claims. A huge problem with bold claims is that sooner or later someone is going to make a fool on you. In this particular case it was rather soon. Marchiori suggested in 1997 that search engines should focus on links while avoiding text while, at the same time, saying that such a thing was unatainable. In 1998 Kleinberg and Brin Page described two different algorithms that working solely from links were able to rank webpages much better than state-of-the-art search engines. The paper by Kleinberg describing HITS algorithms slightly predates the work by Brin Page and, in fact, they cite it. However, there are a number of differences between HITS and PageRank. First of all, Kleinberg did not intend to build a search engine but, instead, to produce a better ranking of a somewhat small set of pages obtained from a given search engine. Secondly, Kleinberg algorithm relied on two characterizing features of webpages represented by two different (albeit mutually reinforcing) scores. Pages could be "authorities" (i.e. pages with highly relevant contents given a topic) or they could be "hubs" (i.e. pages with plenty of links to "authorities" in a given topic). Simply stated, HITS is an iterative algorithm that assign to pages in a graph (not the whole Web graph) both a hub and an authority score. The eventual ranking would be made on the basis of the authority score and, hence, a selection of highly relevant pages would be provided to the user. In contrast, PageRank assumes that web pages are described by just one score which, quite annoyingly, is also named PageRank. The PageRank of a webpage dependes on the number of incoming links but also on the PageRank of web pages issuing those links. Besides, a webpage's PageRank is equally distributed among the outgoing links. This algorithm is, as HITS, iterative and it has got a number of nice properties: It's quite fast (i.e. the number of iterations is relatively small even for large graphs). Second, the initial scores are mostly irrelevant and the eventual ranking is virtually the same without regard to those initial values. Third, the global PageRank in the graph does not change accross iterations but, instead, it is distributed among webpages. A webpage PageRank can be considered a nice proxy for the chance of a user reaching that webpage by randomly visiting links. In other words, pages with larger PageRank values are "central" in the Web. Certainly, as of today PageRank is just one component of Google's ranking methods but back in 1998 it was the core of Google's search engine and it was a huge improvement when compared against state-of-the-art products. However, according to legend , none of major search engines of the time were interested in Brin Page method, neither Yahoo! that at the time was not in the search business. Therefore, Brin Page were "forced" to start their own bussiness, the rest is history . I would not like to close this post, however, without referring to some of the people that made Information Retrieval a mature area before the advent of Web-IR: Luhn, who is the solely inventor of information retrieval systems and automatic summarization , both achievements occuring in IBM during the 1950s; Maron Kuhns, who invented the list of relevant documents in the 1960s; and, of course, the demigods and demigoddess of IR Gerard Salton , Stephen Robertson and Karen Sparck-Jones . As Newton nicely put it, If I have seen further it is by standing on ye sholders of Giants. As usual you can find me at Twitter: PFCdgayo ]] @odo asked my opinion about this opinion piece (in Spanish) about the new Tweets-per-second (TPS) record and the purported uselessness of such a metric. In that piece the journalist argues that TPS is a mostly meaningless metric for two main reasons: on one hand the chat can come from a very vocal minority and, on another hand, there surely must exist (the journalist argument) events with much wider impact than the broadcast of "Castle in the Sky" . He cites as examples bin Laden's death or an iPhone presentation. I have nothing to argue about the vocal minorities argument; it's a real problem when trying to use Twitter to "pulse" public opinion and, in fact, there are some literature about this (see Mustafaraj et al. 2011 ) However, the second argument should be justified and to that end I conducted some back-of-the-envelope research using Google Trends. As you probably know, that tool allows you to compare search volumes for different queries filtering by country (and even region), and also at different time slices. Therefore, I compared queries for "Castle in the Sky", Osama bin Laden, Superbowl, Barack Obama and iPhone. Neither Superbowl or Obama were mentioned in the original newspaper piece but I think they are fair examples. I've limited my research to Japan since, as explained in Twitter's blog, the new TPS record was due to Japanese users. Hence, I used queries in Japanese. After some Wikipedia research and trying different approaches (e.g. Osama bin Laden, Laden, and bin Laden) I eventually employed the following queries:  (Castle in the Sky)  (bin Laden)  (Superbowl)  (Obama) iphone Given that bin Laden's death took place on May 2011 and the TPS record took place on August 2013, I took as time frame from April 2011 to September 2013. In the following graphs you can check how "Castle in the Sky" is extremely popular in Japan, greatly surpassing bin Laden's death (a meager 7% of the peak number of queries for CitS) and Superbowl (52% of the peak number of queries for CitS). Certainly, Obama's victory in 2012 was much more important: the CitS broadcasting responsible for the TPS record achieved just 69% of the queries that got Obama. However, there is something that seems to be really important in Japan, much more than Obama: the iPhone. CitS peaks at 3% of iPhone queries! So, in short, impactful events may be uninteresting for Internet users (either Googlers or Twitterers) and, of course, number of queries or TPS do not reflect the importance of the event but the interest or attention that event got from the Internet population. Now, going back to the usefulness or uselessness of TPS as a metric, many of you may remember past TPS records ( this link is for those of you that cannot remember them) and are wondering how this new record compares to previous ones. The truth is that they are simply not comparable for a number of reasons: Twitter user base was different at each record. First and foremost, larger each time. Events driving to each TPS record were pretty different even when being of worldwide interest. For instance, Superbowl and FIFA World Cup are followed by different populations with a different approach to Twitter. Twitter architecture and infrastructure was different each time. In other words, TPS records are IMHO a signal of Twitter's performance at peak time more than a way to compare moments of worldwide-awe. So, to sum up. TPS provide clues but not the whole story, specially when you compare apples to pears (i.e. different events); however, I think it can be an interesting metric to use when evaluating the "performance" of a single event.

Those results should be the actual vote share (i.e. percentage) received by any party concurring to the election." I feel urged to clarify that because I've been told by a few people that I'm confusing "predicting" with "forecasting", and that talking about "predictions" in social science is not actually about making forecasts. I can, however, accept I'm wrong in that regard; after all, Campbell (2004) or Lewis-Beck (2005) used "forecast" instead of "prediction". Nevertheless, since in common English both "predict" and "forecast" are used almost interchangeably I cannot simply accept the use of "prediction" in the sense of post-facto explanation but only as a statement about a future outcome. That said, we have to establish a way to determine if the forecast/prediction was accurate or not. Forecasting/predicting the winner is tempting but you just cannot do that. If you don't accept my word please accept that by Campbell (2004). Hence, you must compare your forecasts for vote shares against the actual results. To that end, MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is commonly used although you can try a number of different measures (see Lewis-Beck 2005 for alternatives). However, MAE is just a number and you cannot tell if your MAE is small (which is good) or large (which is bad). Indeed, you have to compare your MAE against other MAE to tell if your forecasting/predictive method is good enough or not. Certainly, you can try to compare against traditional polls but it could be unfair to compare a method to predict/forecast the future with a method to ask people about their future behavior. One option is to compare your method against traditional electoral forecasting methods [Oh, you didn't know? Figure it... Political scientists have been trying to forecast/predict elections well before Twitter and Facebook, in fact from the early 1990s ?-cf. Lewis-Beck Rice (1992) and Campbell Garand (2000)] but they can be quite cumbersome. Another option is choosing a reasonable baseline. Here I must clarify what a baseline is. A baseline is not a straw-man method so simplistic that it's almost impossible not to beat it. Nope. A baseline is a reasonably simple (but not simplistic) method to produce acceptable results for the problem at hand if no other method is available. Which could be a reasonable baseline for predicting/forecasting elections? Assuming random results? Obviously not. The most reasonable baseline is assuming the future will repeat the past. That is, that in every election in every place the results will be exactly the same as the prior election. And here we are. I guess that some teams worldwide are preparing for the many elections that are going to take place in different countries. Since I cannot prepare baselines for all of them I'm guessing (not predicting nor forecasting) that the US elections are going to attract some interest. Therefore, I've collected (from Wikipedia) results for gubernatorial, senate and house of representative elections and they are my prediction/forecast for 2014. You can access them here . Gubernatorial and senate are rather simple. I provide there the winner (party) for each race, the vote share for the winner and, as a summary, the number of races won by each party. The House of Representatives is trickier since most of the states are divided in many districts. Therefore, I've provided the "winner" in each state, the vote share in each state and the number of seats for each party in each state. Please note, that forecasting seats is not a good choice and, hence, vote share should be predicted for each district. However, to be sincere, it is too much effort for me at this point to prepare all of this one year before elections and almost two years before papers predicting/forecasting those elections are published ;) What's the plan ahead? November 5, 2014: I'll fill the actual results in the spreadsheet and I'll compute MAE for each kind of election. I'll update the post with comments regarding any forecast/prediction made around that date using social media data. Feel free to comment anything about the data or the post itself.
