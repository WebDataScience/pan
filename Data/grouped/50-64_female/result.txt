God Created us in His own image and seeks a relationship with us. Are you ready in your heart to serve him and have a relationship with Him? As we celebrate and honor the Birth of Jesus, this Christmas is the time to p lace your life in God's hands and acknowledge Him with all your heart. There is much we still need to "do" and He wants you to simply "be" and to slow down and savor these days. Anticipation is not about gifts and food, it is about the birth of Jesus Christ.  You feel anticipation, but is it for Him? This is only a suggestion, but slow down and breathe and give thanks for this busy day... and reach out to those around you that need your help.

Can you imagine how messed up things could have gotten if the men and women had not cooperated?  Elizabeth is an old barren woman and she and her husband Zechariah find she is pregnant with the one that proceed Jesus.  Imagine the gossip in that town. On top of that one, how about Mary and Joseph?  Yeah, Mary did not have much choice with the Holy Spirit fathering her child, but Joseph had to be in total shock... how could he marry a pregnant woman that was to be a virgin when they married? Jesus might have been brought up by an unwed mother. There was so much that could have gone 'wrong' but it did not because it was God's plan.  God's ways are NEVER our ways. We must be faithfully unafraid of what is ahead in our lives. We must trust implicitly.

Totally without words but your heart is so full... you might even be crying.   You could be joyful. You could be afraid.  You could be in pain. Zechariah was 'unable to speak' because the Lord was a bit displeased with Zechariah doubting him when he was told his wife Elizabeth would bear him a son. Impossible. Elizabeth is an old woman. Zechariah was  a priest, a dedicated priest and he disbelieved God's words.  So God took his voice to prove a point. God invites you to believe every single day. You are invited to surrender, to trust and to love. He wants you to be a part of His plans.

If you are a mom or a wife, I am betting you do. If you are a husband, I am betting you do. We are all called to serve each other.  What would it take for you to serve the Lord? How could you do it inside your comfort zone? How could you climb out of your safe zone and serve God as a 'hand maiden' would? Mary was a believer. If there was a hesitation in her mind, it did not last long. She served God. She trusted God. I do not like the phrase Blind Faith... I like it better to think of it as Open Faith. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

This may be it...do not know as I am still discovering things and preparing for 2014 and a new start in the studio. Winner announced tomorrow. Saturday... not sure where the days have gone as we have prepared our hearts as we are close to the fourth week of advent starting tomorrow. This was a week to explore joy... and reasons to have joy.  So easy to walk into a store and see something you are dying to own and just flip out that credit card and buy it. Sheer joy?  Is it really? The feeling lasts what about five minutes before the doubt creeps in, "Should I have spent that money?" and then the rationalizations start, "I can wear it for the Christmas party, and again for dinner out with the family Christmas day..." How about flipping out that credit card and buying a coat to warm that older woman standing out on the street, or buying a new bike to donate to a local charity gathering toys for children that will not have Christmas. Or this time of year when you eat out...double the tip for your wait staff. My favorite memory doing just this was going out to breakfast with our 15 year old grandson before Christmas. We stood in a long line at a waffle house. About 45 min later we were seated at the bar and we slid Jon in between us and ordered.  The food was hot and fresh and the woman that waited on us was the same one trying to handle the long line waiting outside the door. They were short of staff.  I overheard her talking to her family, a child, on the phone saying she would be home after lunch. She must have had the five a. m. shift, but her smile stayed bright as she visited with everyone making sure the morning was special for all of us and our food hot.  As we sat there, I knew what I wanted to do. We had some cash with us to finish Christmas shopping.   When we left, I paid with my credit card but handed her a folded up envelope with a $100 bill tucked inside and thanked her.  She smiled and wished me Merry Christmas and tucked the sealed envelop deep in her apron pocket.  Out in the car Jon was asking questions. It was such a wonderful time to teach him that giving what you have to others, and learning to do without so others could have something they needed, was pretty special. Terry and I decided then not to buy gifts for each other that year and we would continue to give to others as their 'light' brightened our lives.

This is the fourth Sunday in Advent. I really do not know where the time has gone in December.

Everything is in His time and not ours.

Mary said: My being proclaims the greatness of the Lord, my spirit finds joy in God my savior, For he has looked upon his servant in her lowliness; all ages to come shall call me blessed. God who is mighty has done great things for me, holy is his name; His mercy is from age to age on those who fear him. My husband and I spend time with our advent wreath doing a reading and a small study each day.  This is the beginning of the third week in advent.  This week is our 'joy' week. We lit a candle for 'hope' each day the first week and 'peace' each day the second week. This is a time of anticipation, one filled with joy, and at the same time with our reading the full realization of the true gift of Jesus to the world.  It is often hard to get past the everyday chaos or sadness that surround us to find the way to the joy of lighting this third candle. So as you light your third candle today, Mary's Candle,  remember to give thanks for all you have been given. No matter what life has brought you, or how busy you are, stop tonight and give thanks for the light we walk in, the freedom to walk there and the joy of His love and grace... in His Light and His Love. Your mission is to be content in your life. Give to others.  Give what they need even if you must give a part of what you have. Let go of your anxiety and stay in prayer to God. Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your request known to God.  Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

Laurie and Terry Pace ]] How Great Thou Art, Five Hearts by Texas Artist Laurie Pace, Music by Carrie Underwood, "How Great Thou Art" from Laurie Pace on Vimeo . Here is the full process on this painting.  Wishing you the best of the season, His love and His grace. Zechariah was silenced by God for his disbelief in God's miracle for Zechariah and Elizabeth to have a child.  Zechariah was pretty old when John was born.  (thinking back to Abraham and Sarah, they were between 90 and 100 years of age when Sara gave birth to Isaac.) For nine months Zechariah did not speak and when his son John was born, his first words were of praise and thanksgiving with the realization that sometimes you have to trust the impossible. We are all part of God's plan and He waits daily for us to respond. Open your heart, your eyes and your ears to all around you. Feel the warmth of His unconditional love that is yours for the taking. Open your hands and your heart to receive it this day. Our family gathers this day at our home to share the joys of the Christmas story, sing Christmas songs with guitars and harmonizing voices and share a meal on Christmas Eve... blessings to you and your families.

A Partridge in a Pear Tree The partridge in a pear tree is Jesus the Christ, the Son of God, whose birthday we celebrate on December 25, the first day of Christmas. In the song, Christ is symbolically presented as a mother partridge that feigns injury to decoy predators from her helpless nestlings, recalling the expression of Christ's sadness over the fate of Jerusalem: "Jerusalem! Jerusalem! How often would I have sheltered you under my wings, as a hen does her chicks, but you would not have it so . . . ."

After visiting New York in 2010 and watching the competition of jumpers there for a cool 'million' first place, I was upfront in the press area shooting images to paint from.
