Since I've been SAHM'ing, I've been a little.... lost? I don't necessarily "define" myself as a working-mom, but I have been working for a long time. The adjustment to being a full-time, at home parent has been jarring, honestly. Not bad, mind you, just.... different. I definitely enjoy the face time with the kids, and - DEFINITELY - the freeeeee time I have, now that the kids are back at school. But for the first time in ages, I'm not really on a schedule, besides Gab's school schedule. I have so much free time, I kind of get overwhelmed and freeze because I don't know what to do with it all. That sure sounds like crazypeople talk. Anyway, with all this freeeeeee time, you'd think I could at least be running some decent miles. AND YET. This is what lazyass looks like I'm partially convinced that my problem is that I had no races coming up - #1's cross country scheduling made fall plans mighty tricky for racing - so I've picked a December half, and start training..... Monday. Whee. With that, I guess, Plan for the Week is making a comeback! Monday : 3 mi easy, XT Tuesday : 6 mi, speed Wednesday : XT Thursday : 5 easy Friday : 8 (with middle miles race pace), XT Saturday : rest Sunday : 3 easy or rest I have kept up on the video trifecta ( Tank Top Arms , Core , Glutes/Thighs ), so at least there's that? (And, ps, I DO have muscle in my arms, and and AND I did full pushups - not on my knees - so I guess those videos do work....). In other news.... As I said, #1 joined cross country at her high school, and is busy being so fast . They train hard, they train a LOT, and she's made amazing improvements already. When she started going to camp, her 5k time on July 4th was 24:xx (her 5k PR from Chapman 2011 was 22:08). At an invitational last weekend, she came in sub-20 in a 3 mile race. I would probably puke, if I didn't die first. I don't want to brag (lie), but she's killing it - she's already been asked to run varsity, and I'm really excited to watch the rest of her season. Which races every single weekend. All of the weekends. All over Southern California. Every weekend. Excitingly, #2 has expressed an interest in going running, too, so I am hoping to log some easy miles with her this week. And Gab has been accompanying us to some of the races, and mostly spends her time being like this. Grass Angels? And in non-kid news, remember my infatuation with Evan Dando last year ? After an 18 month dry-spell in the SoCal tour front, Evan finally returned to OC this weekend, and man, it was glorious. Of note, that is NOT the infamous black shirt he wore for 6 months straight in 2011-2012, his voice sounds AMAZING, and he is seemingly clean and sober. Thank goodness. And, finally, I am for SURE an old, old, old person . I have a really FUN story to share another day about annoying people. My favorite day of the week is grocery store circular day. ]] Six months, cancer free. Last month, she had some swollen lymph nodes in her throat - her pediatrician was surprised she hadn't complained, because they were caused by tonsillitis, and some infection funk in her throat. Gab insisted she felt fine - I'm not sure how I feel about that. Did she really feel fine? Was she so used to being uncomfortable that a little sore throat didn't even register? Did she think it was just... normal? Who knows. I guess we'll figure it out in time. Over the summer, we also had some cognitive testing done on her - the chemo treatments she received are known to cause cognitive issues, and we had some concerns. She came away from the testing with an "Unspecified Cognitive Disorder" - basically, something is off, but she's so young, it's hard to say what specifically it is. It's something we'll have to keep watching as she continues in school, and re-test as we go. The last six months have been quiet, but I'm not sure that it will ever be "easy". I'm consistently on guard, watching for anything that's "off". But - just like during her treatment - she's just a normal kid. She plays with My Little Pony, she is obsessed with dinosaurs ( still ), she picks up every single leaf she finds when we take a walk. I have said this a million times, through diagnosis and treatment, but we are so, so lucky. We are lucky that she has such an optimistic attitude, that nothing phases her. We are lucky that she is the kid she is. We are lucky that we had the access to the care we did, and that it worked for her. Today, she started first grade. ]] She finished in 20:55, 9th place overall female. Since she has pretty much taken a MAJOR break since camp ended in the beginning of August, that's an excellent time. She's so fast! School finally starts for her next week, with her first real meet on the 14th - I'm psyched to see what she can accomplish with some real training. 2. Last week, I ran 3 miles Friday, 6.2 Saturday, 13.1 Sunday, and then decided following that with a 10 mile trail run on Monday would be the best idea ever. It really was! It was a beautiful morning - we left super early, and did 10 easy pace miles around Crystal Cove. Ages ago, I went on a naturalist-led hike in an adjacent park, where the ranger said that there are no mountain lions south of the toll roads (because, DUH, animals know they belong north of the toll roads...). But that paw print was 1. not a dog, and 2. GIGANTOR. It's either a mountain lion, or a dinosaur. Either one, I won't be running that trail alone again for awhile... 3. I feel a little silly recapping the Disneyland Half, since I've done it three years in a row. So here are the pictures, and you can just imagine the caption for all of them being, "THIS IS THE MOST FUN EVER!". "Where should I stash my needle and thread?" What. So hot, so sunny. LOVED THIS STOP. (just before you get inside Angels Stadium) Almost a full on collision with a wall.... ]] Troutman Sanders Santa Run in December, where I PR'ed the 10k by 3 minutes last year WHAT. (Right? Remember when I was "fast"?). If you're a local athlete interested in applying, check out the application HERE - deadline to apply is Sept. 15th, so hustle! 2. Blog friend Elizabeth from Running for Bling is running RnR Nola in February with Team in Training . She has raised around $10,000 for LLS over the years, and this time she will be running in honor of her super cute cousin Cooper, and Gab. I love this picture. If you have a second, go check out her TNT story, Cooper's story, and help find a cure for blood cancers. 3. So.... the kids are at school. And I'm just.. hanging out. Running, some, cross training, watching an excessive amount of tv, baking.... I don't really know what to do with this nonsense called "free time". I woke up and kind of wanted to run today, but it was a rest day. I don't even have anything on my race calendar right now, besides Tink in JANUARY. What?! I don't even recognize myself any more. If ever I were going to train for another marathon, I suppose now would be a good time, since I seem to have ALL THE FREE HOURS EVER. I previously intended to add Paso Robles Marathon to my calendar, but with me being unemployed, it feels like kind of a jackass thing to do right now - spending a weekend away chasing a race. I've kind of checked out local races, but I'm just not really feeling them. Well, the exception to that is Carlsbad, which I'd LOVE to do, but it interferes with Tink. Womp. Anyway. That was a lot of words to say I'm kind of bored? But I have perfected a banana muffin recipe, so at least there's that. If you want to drop by.... I'm available. Pretty much always.]] related to yesterday's post, is that the point of the blog post, as I read it, is that Matt Walsh is a jerkface. One thing that I don't need is a guy running his yapper in defense of my choices. For realsies, though, I don't begrudge anyone else their decision to stay at home or work - I am okay at playing this game with school-age kids, but I would have LOST my mind with smaller kids. The good thing about this gig, though, is I really like cooking and baking and I get to do a lot of that? It's just not as simple as he says, that having a mom at home is the best, the end. I wish people would acknowledge that more often, and spend less time selling the SAHM bill. 2. The lack of doing any real stuff is why I haven't been blogging much. There's just not much to say, when I'm not scrambling around to fit in all of the mom stuff around work, and when I have no work stuff to complain about. 3. I've got the Marathon Itch. FINALLY! I've been hesitant to get too ambitious and register for anything when I'm juuuuuuust finding my running groove again, but now I am antsy to start 18 and 20 mile weekends again. 28 Reasons Why Training for a Marathon is the Worst Thing Ever. Except that you are ravenous all the time so youre not actually getting in shape. Yep. 4. #1 is running with Varsity for the first time this weekend! She's been sick the last few races - last weekend, she was not too far off of her PR, so I'm excited to see how she performs this weekend. 5. Unrelated to anything, THIS WOMAN GAVE BIRTH 88 DAYS AGO . WTF, Kate. ]] Monday - easy 2 Run/Walk with #2. We did an easy 2:1 run/walk ratio, trying to teach her to paaace herself. She's a great sprinter, but then blows up early. She had a lot of smack to talk during the early intervals. By the last one, she was begging to walk. HAHAHAHA. Tuesday - easy 5 Nothing exciting. Easy 5 miles with random strides. Wednesday - cross training Tank Top Arms, core, vinyasa flow yoga. Thursday - long run Weather was cool and overcast - easy 8 miles outside, steady pace with slight negative splits. Friday - cross training Repeat of Wednesday. Saturday - rest Spent the day out with the family. Sunday - speeeeed 3x1600. Gross. Goal pace was 8:45-9, actual was 9:02, 8:56, 8:49. Challenging, but not the worst ever. Total: 21 miles. 21 miles seems to be my happy spot - I feel fine, nothing feels like it needs extra recovery, all of the runs were manageable, I'm not dying of runger. So far, the Jerk Shin has behaved nicely, but I'm assuming it will resume its jerkiness as I add miles. Someone asked last week about what training plan I'm using - I built my own based partially on the Train Like a Mother book, and Run Less, Run Faster. I don't like running 5 times a week, like TLAM suggests, but I'm willing to give it a shot to see how it works as the weeks progress. If they're easy miles, it could be fine - especially since I have plenty of free time. BUT, I have supplemented my fall/winter schedule with a few shorter distance races, so I've pulled some of the speed workouts from RLRF to keep building speed - I just can't do the All Speed, All The Time RLRF program, it doesn't work for my janky legs. Eh. We'll see how it goes. The nice thing about making your own isht up, is you can change whatever you feel like changing. This week, #1 races on Thursday instead of Saturday, so I may move things around. Or not. I don't know. OH, and also, Tuesday is OC Run Club night, so that may be shifting things around, too. I'll figure it out as I go, I guess.... Monday : easy 2-3 miles, XT Tuesday : tempo (ick), 5 miles Wednesday : XT Thursday : 6 miles, easy Friday : XT Saturday : Long - 10 miles Sunday : rest *********************************************************************** On Saturday, we headed up to Yucaipa for the Yucaipa Cross Country Invitational. The course has one "nice hill" at the end of the first mile.... which #1 used to pass everyone. She started up the hill in 6th or 7th, from what we could see. She crested in 2nd. Making her move (can you find her?) I guess this is what it looks like to be FAST? I don't know, it hardly looks like she's working hard. She was able to maintain that lead, and finished in 2nd place in the freshman/sophomore Gold division race. It's so ugly where we live. Dumb hills and mountains. ]] Becka ran ONE HUNDRED MILES this weekend. ONE HUNDRED. That's CRAZY. I can't wait for the recap. ******************************************************************* Last week.... Monday : XT Tank Top Arms, Core Tuesday : Arms? Ages ago, the passenger window in my van stopped working. I would always say that it wasn't that big of a deal (until it was really hot in the summer and I wished I could roll it down, because -ahem- the AC also doesn't work), because at least it was UP and not down. And then, about a month ago, it ROLLED DOWN, all by itself. And wouldn't go back up. So for a few weeks, it was fine, because our weather is nice, and since I'm not commuting, I don't drive too often. But then there was finally rain in our forecast last week, so.... we googled the problem, purchased a part (a new motor for the windows), and did this... And now it works, and I fixed it just in time to NOT soak the inside of my van. It was fairly easy - definitely easy enough that I feel dumb for waiting so long to do it :D. Anyway, my arms were EXHAUSTED after doing this, so I called it cross training, lol. Wednesday : Tempo 5 miles, 3 at tempo. Goal pace was 9:25-9:11, actual 9:12, 9:22, 8:54. It felt hard, but only REALLY hard the last 400m or so. Overall pace 9:39. Thursday : XT Arms, core, and yoga. #1 had an after-school race - her first league meet of the season. It was a tough course, pretty hilly, and she has been struggling to kick a nasty cold. AND YET, she finished 4th place in the freshman/sophomore race, first for her school, at 20:08. Super powers, maybe? While I certainly enjoy watching the races, these events are draining - they last FOREVER. FOREVER. This one was not so bad, because there were only 6 races I think, but they were 30 minutes apart, so it just goes on and on. At least it was pretty? It's FALL. See? Friday : Rest! It was Gab's birthday, so I spent hours making a BRIGHT-ASS purple cake with neon pink frosting. I have no idea what came over me, but it was ridiculous. Saturday : Easy 6 miles strides - did this one on the treadmill, and ran fast-ish pace during commercials. Overall pace 9:55. Sunday : Long 10 miles - I ran a local route, with the first half on some hilly trails, and second half on roads (well, sidewalks). H came with me, and we had a lovely run. AND, it was faaaast (for me!). Average pace was 10:13 - the last time we did this route, my average pace was 10:54. What. Total: 21 miles So, I'm intrigued that I really am not running a ton of mileage, but I'm getting some pretty drastic improvements in pace over the last month or so. Maybe there really is something to blah blah strength training... Next week..... Monday : XT Tuesday : Easy 4 Wednesday : Long (13) Thursday : XT Friday : 6 with 4 at race pace Saturday : XT? Easy run? #1 has a race, lord knows how long that will take me out.... Sunday : Rest! ]] Monday : Cross training Core and arms. I let myself stop doing the glutes/thigh video, and THAT WAS DUMB. It's going to be the worst ever when I start doing it again. Tuesday : 4 easy Nothing interesting. Ran 4 outside, easy pace, with negative splits (not on purpose, it just happened that way). 10:13 avg. Wednesday : XT Core, arms, yoga. I also (re)started the 100 pushups program - day one completed. Thursday : 6 miles, speedyish 1 mile warm up, 4 at race pace, 1 cool. Hit goal pace just fine. Thought I had an achy hip, but since it didn't bother me when I started running, and didn't bother me after, maybe my brain was faking? Friday : XT Arms, and day 2 of 100 pushups. Saturday : Rest XC spectating, which consisted of an easy hike and some sprinting around the course to watch #1 race. Sunday : Long! 13 easy miles - 12 easy pace, last mile at race pace. No problems, avg pace 10:26. Caught up on Master Chef and some of Million Dollar Listing. I love Bravo - it's the only thing I miss about not having cable! Total: 23 miles I think I've finally worn out my last pair of originally PureFlows. I'm so, so, so sad. Next week..... Monday : XT Tuesday : 3-4 easy Wednesday : Long - 14 with 5@race pace Thursday : rest Friday : 6 mi, XT Saturday : Rest Sunday : 5 Tempo ******************************************************************** On Saturday, #1 ran the OC Champs Invitational . For her first varsity experience, her team ran the sweepstakes race. Did you know sweepstakes mean "super duper fast"? Surprise! She finished in 20:03 - her second fastest time yet. Her PR is from a month ago, on a flat course, in cool weather. This was a hilly course on a warm day. It was an interesting experience - moving from the freshman/sophomore races up to a varsity sweepstakes race means that her previously impressive placing was no longer... well, it was just not great in the field she raced against. It was - for her - a great race individually. It's a much more strategic race when those kids are involved - so it'll be fun to see how she picks up on this, if she takes the coaching from her teammates, and what she does with it. We had to be at the park so, so early (6:15, what!).... the moon was up, but the sun wasn't.. We spent a few hours hiking around... this is the hill in mile 1 that they had to run up. NO THANKS. then playing on the playground by the start line. Personal request to OC XC planners - all start lines should be playground adjacent. ]] HAHAHA JK. Actually, I just don't have a ton of interesting things going on right now (still), so there's not much to share? Last week..... I had a really great training week! Monday : Cross training Tank Top Arms, Core, and pushups. I'm SHOCKED at the improvement in pushups. Fascinating! Did you know, consistency helps?! Tuesday : 4 miles Easy run on the beach path at Crystal Cove. It was super ugly, with the sunset and sweeping ocean views. Via the Instagram Wednesday : Long run I had time, and there was a bunch of Bravo stuff I wanted to watch on, so I long run'ned on the treadmill. I was a little concerned, because I ran long on Sunday... but 14 miles, with 5 mid-miles at goal pace. NAILED IT. Goal pace was dead on, and I finished with an overall 10:03 pace - which is my current half PR pace, and it almost killed me dead. It was a great, great run. Thursday : XT Arms and pushups Friday : Easy/XT Core in the morning, then a 6 mile, easy pace, negative split run. Saturday : Rest Actually, I did pushups, but it was only 10 minutes and barely counts. Sunday : Tempo 5 miles total, mid 3 at 9:25-9:11. Actual was 9:24, 9:17, 9:14. It was a little tough, but not unbearable. Total: 29 miles. Solid. I finally replaced my poor shoes.... And all my panicky trepidation was for naught. The Flow2's seem to be juuuuuust fine. Saddest transition ever. This week..... Monday : 3 easy, XT Tuesday : 7, speeeeeed Wednesday : XT Thursday : 5 easy with strides Friday : XT Saturday : 10 easy Sunday : rest Yaaaay cut back week! ************************************************************************ No pictures from #1's race this week (I cannot even believe that they for real race EVERY SINGLE WEEK that's crazy), because we didn't go. It was far away, they were being bused, and we would never have made it on time after getting Gab and #2 from school. BUT, she raced with varsity, and did GREAT. 15th place!!!! What. 18:24 on a 2.7 mile (random) hilly course. I spent a lot of Friday and Saturday keeping up on the Mt Sac Invitational - #1's school only participated in the boy's varsity sweepstakes race, but I tried watching the parts I could keep track of. Sarah Baxter - a senior at Simi Valley - is a robot fast running machine. She has won every high school race she's run. Photo cred Juan Carlo Oh wait, turns out she's human. Here's a great article on her race Saturday . I went out way too fast and I shouldnt have done that, Baxter said. I kind of let it get away from me and didnt realize how fast I was going until it was too late. Says the girl who ran a 4:58 first mile...... Zoinks. After that, I spent hours and hours searching for a winter/spring marathon, and as a result, updated my "Wish List" with a ridiculous number of options.... Someone stop me. ]] SAHM's, WHAT DO YOU DO ? I've been staying at home for just over 2 months now, and I have to say... It's a pretty easy gig. I'm probably exceptionally lucky for a few reasons: 1. It was financially sketchy, but not a crisis, for me to stay home right now. 2. My kids are pretty self-sufficient - on purpose, we have made them that way. 3. My kids are older - at 14, 12, and 7, they can do a lot of things on their own. So while my circumstances are maybe different than what Matt Walsh is using as reference, I'm still a SAHM*.... and since he asked, THIS is what I did Tuesday: 6-6:15 - wake up, roll out of bed, start coffee. H and #1 are already up - she has to be at school at 7, and he has to be at work at 7. He rides his bike, she usually rides mine (unless I'm feeling exceptionally kind and give her a ride). #2 is usually also awake, but she leaves later than they do. Yesterday, this part was REALLY exciting, because I almost started a fire when my coffee maker died a dramatic, smokey death. 6:30 - spend a billion minutes trying to drag Gab out of bed. Giving her the top bunk was a terrible plan, she is NOT a morning person. (Unless it's a weekend, then she's up at 6). 6:40-7:25 - try to get her to eat breakfast, but she's the slowest moving human ever. 7:25-7:55 - drag Gab through teeth brushing, hair styling, getting dressed, and shove her out of the house. 7:55-8:30 - walk Gab to school - usually she rides her scooter and I walk with her. #2 comes with us, and walks to school from there. I walk back home with the scooter. 8:30-8:45 - consider running outside. It's cool now, but I hate being hot, and the sun is out. Decide to just run and stop thinking about it so hard. 8:45-9:30 - quick 4 mile easy run around the neighborhood. Schedule was for 4 easy, and I just made loops until I hit that. Pace felt easy, and I avoided checking the Garmin, but it was negative splits, so that was exciting. Wheeee. 9:30-10 - think about how much I want coffee RIGHT NOW, eat some breakfast, drink chocolate milk - a poor substitute :(. 10-10:45 - check Amazon for replacement coffee makers. Consider my options, debate if the potential savings is worth waiting for. Decide I must stop at Target to buy a replacement, because I will surely perish without it for 24 hours. 10:45-11:30 - read blogs, dick around on twitter/fb/etc. Find reviews of an Evan Dando show last weekend. Think about applying for Amazing Race, and decide that would be CRAZY.... 11:30-12 - Consider lunch options. I'm feeling lazy (more than usual...), and kind of want to just toss some chicken nuggets in the oven. Briefly consider going out to Souplantation for lunch. Decide I'm not quite that lazy, and make eggs instead - egg whites, ham, a ton of spinach, some cheddar cheese, and then drown all that isht in salsa verde. I've been eating this for weeks. 12-12:05 - Complain via text to the H that I wish I had coffee RIGHT NOW. Realize I'm being ridiculous because I am, in fact, doing absolutely nothing, and could just go get some. Then immediately realize that I'm too lazy.... 12:05-2 - play around on the internet, googling info on #1's XC meet this weekend. Watch TV. Deadliest Catch on Netflix streaming, then the end of an episode of Party of Five on Amazon Plus. Get half-way through before I have to pick up Gabby. 2-2:45 - pick up Gab at school, then head to Target to pick out a new coffee maker. THANK GOD. She's also being super adorable, so I buy her a slushie. I'm so nice to her. 2:45-3:15 - head to #2's school and wait for her. When she shows up at the car, ask how school was. "Fine." What'd you do? "I don't know. Nothing." She DOES spill that she was invited to a Halloween party, so that's exciting - she's had a little bit of a rough transition to middle school this year, and her BFF moved away a few weeks ago, so I'm really glad to see her excited about something. 3:15-5 - get Gab started on homework - 2 math worksheets and reading. Thankfully, this math I can still do, but they use weird words and terminology. I'm not a fan - it is just overly complicated. Look over #2's homework assignments - her teachers post everything online, so I make sure to review it every day, and watch her do it. Otherwise, she will be mysterious and sneaky and not actually do it. This is probably the most exhausting part of my day - chasing down 7th grade homework. Review her grades, and get irritated that she's not turning things in. She's so dang smart and is sabotaging herself. She will never, ever be ungrounded this school year... The H shows up at home around 4:15ish. Says he wants to run, and then kind of hangs out until... 5-5:20 - #1 calls and asks to be picked up from cross country practice. The H is really nosey and rides with me so he can ask her a million questions. She was doing 400's - they got through 6, I think?, at an 80sec pace. Laugh inside at the idea of trying that. I would die dead. 5:20-6:30 - H finally goes to run. I make dinner - grilled pork chops, baked potatoes, grilled asparagus. It's delicious. 6:30-8 - watch tv. I watch a lot of tv. 8-8:45 - make lunches for the next day, make more coffee for me (I drink a LOT of coffee), clean up the kitchen. 8:45-9 - convince kids to get to bed. 9-10:30 - watch tv, some more. It's my expertise. The great thing is, I have every morning free, from 8:30-2 (or 1 if Gab is getting out of school early). Sometimes I cross train, sometimes go grocery shopping, sometimes... nothing at all. It's pretty great. Living the dream.... ]] ]] 2. JK, Gab is randomly out of school today, so we have some exciting Barnes and Noble + hiking plans to fill the time. 3. Speaking of Gab, she self-patrolled herself last night while Trick or Treating. When her bucket got full, she said, "Well, I guess we're done now!". And was ready to head home. Huh. That's new..... At first, I was a little bummed because FREE CANDY. Then I remembered we bought two bags of candy to hand out, and had three ToT'ers. So.... Anyone want some candy? Please? #1 and #2 went to parties. I guess they're too big for ToT'ing with their parents. (WHEEEEE) 4. I stumbled onto this blog a few days ago, which makes me feel significantly better about my Evan Dando adoration (because I swear this isn't my tumblr, I barely even know what tumblr is). HE'S CAPTIVATED. (#2 just saw this, and asked if this was Jesus....) 5. #1 raced in their second league meet yesterday (who holds a XC race on Halloween!??!). She ran with varsity again, and at first, seemed kind of on edge. She looks so tense! At first, The H started getting spazzy at her overall placement. Then I realized that she came through the mile we were at WAY earlier than we anticipated, and I got psyched. When she came through the finish at 45 seconds UNDER HER PR, I wasn't really ready for it. Blurryfast She destroyed her PR, and finished at 18:54ish (unofficial). She came across the finish line with a HUGE smile on her face, and later said she was so happy when she saw her time that she almost cried. The support from her teammates was adorable, and her middle school PE teacher was there, and it was just so, so great. She's struggled a little moving up to varsity, and no longer being the "big fish" in the smaller Freshman pond, so I think this will do good things for her confidence. ]] Because I love nothing more than watching people and giving them judgey eyes, I've been collecting in my brain the most bizarre and irritating things I've seen so far... 1. The Kid People. You guys, your kids don't belong IN the gym. If your little sunshine is running around unsupervised while you "use" the treadmill to walk a 2.0mph pace so you can say you worked out while watching tv, that that isht outside. Go to a damn park. Don't let the hellion play with a giant exercise ball and bounce it around until it LODGES UNDER MY TREADMILL belt and stops it while I'm running. 2. The Fakers. Did you know, if you're standing on the sides of the treadmill while the belt runs, you're not actually doing any work , so those miles DON'T EVEN COUNT? I know, it's true. Samesies for the ones who jack up the incline on the treadmill, push the pace up to 2.3, and lean waaaaay back and hold on for dear life. This counts. 3. My New BFF. If I'm in the gym, chances are good that I'm there with a plan in mind. That plan probably didn't involve becoming your new BFF. Let me work out in peace. 4. The Confused Ones. The treadmill is not that confusing. The buttons are all labeled. Up goes faster, down goes slower, the big red one stops everything. 5. I CHANGED MY MIND, UNDO UNDO UNDO! The first time, I thought it was just someone that forgot something. But since it's happened a few times, I'm assuming this is a thing people just do, coming into the gym for 5-10 minutes, jumping from machine to machine without realllllly doing anything, and just leaving. Did they just suddenly realize this was not what they intended to do, at all? I feel you. 6. The Drama Llama. We get it. You are working hard. So is almost everyone else. Is the exaggerated sweat wipe and heaving breaths necessary? 7. You Faaaaancy. This is more because I'm jealous than anything, but if you come in and bust out some super fast 5k on the neighboring treadmill, and jump off looking refreshed and shiny, I hate you a little. I think that's it. People are weird. Hope everyone has a good weekend! #1 is running her last race to qualify for states tomorrow, so keep your fingers crossed for her - they have a solid chance, so we could be headed up to Fresno over Thanksgiving! ]] HERE. I am pretty sure she's the fastest person ever. Last week.... Monday : XT Arms, pushups, core Tuesday : strides 5 outside miles. I left, and it was cloudy and cool. Within a mile, it looked like THIS. ALL THE SUN I ran up and down a couple of shady portions of trail to make my five miles, pulling some strides between light poles to kill the time. Boring, but got it done. Wednesday : XT Arms, core Thursday : 1600's Had 4 repeats on schedule, but my plans got changed at the last minute and could only squeeze in 3 - yeah yeah, all that babbling awhile ago about how I have all the time in the world , but Thursday was for real packed, between last minute costume shopping, #1's race, trick or treating, 2 kids going to 2 separate parties. Anyway. 1 mile warm up, 1600's at 8:47, 8:48, 8:45, 400 RI. Right on target. Friday : rest! Gab had a random day off of school (weird, since the other schools were all in session...), so we spent the day going to breakfast, shopping for some books, and being silly. " Can you take a picture and call it, 'Riding a Frog with no Hands!'" Saturday : XT 100 push-ups program - up to 47 for real, on my toes not my knees push-ups. What. Sunday : Long 10 miles easy pace, while watching NYCM. Didn't feel warmed up until around mile 8, so that was pretty annoying. Eh. It's done. Total: 20 miles. Felt sort of bleh the whole week, so hopefully the cut-back week was all I needed and this week sucks less? This week..... Monday : XT Tuesday : OC Run Club - 4ish Wednesday : XT, 3ish Thursday : Long - 13 Friday : XT Saturday : 2x2mi repeats bleargh Sunday : rest ]] Monday : 5k/5 miles Recap of the almost-5k here . Results were posted earlier this week.... LOL at 7:31 pace. Immediately after, I swore I would be retiring from 5k's forever, because I'd rather run a marathon than sprint for 3.1 miles. But - since this course was shooooooort, I'm kind of thinking I might try a re-do in December at the Renegade Santa Run . Based on last year's results, there's an outside shot at an age group placing.... Tuesday : Rest? Wednesday : More rest? Thursday : Long run On paper, this run went well. 14 miles total, broken into one hour warm-up, 6 miles at race pace (9:33 for me), and cool down to finish. However, I was MESSED UP. I didn't drink enough, and was sweating a ton, and probably started not-well-hydrated, and by mile 7 or 8, I had a giant headache. I ignored it for awhile, but eventually, any time I tried to drink, I just felt gross and sloshy. Somehow, I also forgot to bring any fuel with me, which is RIDICULOUS, since long runs = salted caramel gu time, so how is that even possible?? I was supposed to run 15, but quit at 14. My overall pace was great, and my BODY felt fine, I am just dumb. I didn't go through one bottle of water during the run; after, I drank 3 bottles of Nuun, plus a giant diet coke, and didn't pee for hours and hours and hours. I am not a professional. Friday : 3 easy Weather was beautiful - cool, overcast, a little drizzly - so I did a quick 3 easy from the Target parking lot, before picking up a few things. Saturday : planned off day #1 raced Saturday, more on this below. Her race was mid-afternoon, which is really just the worst time of them all, and it just kills the entirety of the day. Sunday : rest Saturday's spectating beat me down hard. Total: 22 miles Zero cross-training. Oops. I just didn't really feel like it - the 5k killed me pretty dead, and so did that long run. Lame. I guess these videos and push-ups are going to be extra terrible this week. This week.... I originally planned to start taper this week, buuuuuut *spoiler alert* there's a fair shot of #1's team heading to states the same weekend as the race I wanted to do, but.... I'm doing a higher volume than I initially planned, but nothing craaazy, just in case . Monday : 3-4 easy Tuesday : off Wednesday : 6 strides Thursday : 4 easy Friday : 8-10 easy Saturday : off Sunday : off ********************************************************************** XC updates.... #1 ran CIF Southern Section prelims Saturday at Mt. Sac. Mt. Sac is a notoriously hard course - there's three significant hills starting with a set of switchbacks just after the first mile. The H and I walked the course during lunch break, and holy crap, it was HARD to walk. I have no idea how these kids (i'm so old, "these kids") run this course, and run it so faaaaaast. Simi Valley, home of Sarah Baxter, is in our division, so I got to see her race just before #1 did. To the surprise of no one, she destroyed the field. from Instagram : "Sarah Freakin' Baxter" She is really impressive to watch. There's no one, anywhere near her, and she barely looks like she's making an effort. Totally unrelated to this post or race, but here is a GREAT article on Sarah's course record run from last year . #1's team raced a bit later, and came in 3rd in their heat, which advances them on to finals next weekend. True to the course, #1 breezed through the first mile well under 6 minutes, because she has super-teleportation-powers. Somewhere on the switchbacks, she lost her teammate - it's a tricky course, and one she was new on. Somewhere in here, she started struggling with something in her eyeball. After the race, we saw her coach meet her at the finish line with her bag, frantically digging through it, and I had no idea what was happening. Apparently, she tried to tell her coach she got some funk in her eyeball, and was having trouble seeing/not dying, but the coach thought she was saying she needed her inhaler (she doesn't use an inhaler, lol). I am always a little nervous about the portions of the race where we can't see her, so I am greatly comforted knowing that her coaches are watching out for her too. Awwwww. Anyway. She said she really enjoyed the course (WHAT), so I'm psyched to see them advance and see what happens next weekend. Several of the girls on the team this year are new to Mt Sac, so hopefully this was a good training run for them, in prep for next week, and with some experience on the course, they can really make some strides in their performance. Get it? Strides? adorable. I love this picture. So, as much as it kind of feels like XC is the season that just keeps on going.... I'm really excited, and we're having a lot of fun with it. It's pretty great seeing the girls' enthusiasm and camaraderie. Yaaaaaaay, maybe-Fresno? ]] This counts as refueling, right, because I ate it after a run? 2. Earlier this year, I ran the Run4Kids 24 hour relay event with Rose . I loved the event so much, that I believe I'm ready to throw my hat in the ultra ring...... Yeah, it's sort of a cheater course, being very flat, but whatever. 24 hours is a long time, yo. I've not really picked a mileage goal yet - I'll do that as I get closer to the event - but drew up a training plan last night, and um... I guess that's it. I am pretty excited. 3. After months and MONTHS of not running any races, I've suddenly got #alltheraces lined up. First, my favorites, are a few Renegade Events... Troutman Sanders Renegade Santa Run on Dec. 14. I ran the 10k here last year for a huge PR , and had so much fun. Dun dun DUN. iTRYathlon is back in February!! The event is open to everyone, so I think The H will be joining me in the fun (and destroying me, because he's the fastest and loves the bike, UNLIKE ME). (PS just realized this means I need to add swimming back to my training plan. BRRRRRR.) The Coaster Run through Knott's Berry Farm . In addition to supporting a great cause (the Speech and Language Development Center in Buena Park) AND the adorable medal, they have pie at the finish line. I love pie. I'll be doing this one with the kids. {{For any of the above, you can register using code HEATHERDISCOUNT for 10% off}} In addition to those fun events, I have.... these to fill in my calendar: Nov. 11 - Veteran's Day 5k . I stumbled on this last week, and it's down the street from me. I've been wanting to fit in a shorter race to get an idea of my current fitness level, and this is perfect. I'm hoping to PR - my existing PR is 27:47 from last July - but the pace sure seems faaaaast. We'll see? December Half Marathon - I'm waffling between a few options. Option 1: Holiday Classic Half - this one is CHEAP, and looks like a ton of fun. I really prefer smaller, more local races, and this one is my top choice, BUT I may have a scheduling conflict this weekend. Maybe. So I'm on hold. The timing of this one is best, because I am ready to race a half RIGHT NOW. Option 2: Holiday Half Marathon - this one is a little lot pricier, because I've been super lazy about registering, plus there are parking fees which irritate me. It's an okay time for me, but I'm not in love with it (probably why I haven't registered yet....) Option 3: San Diego Holiday Half Marathon - this one is reasonably priced (there are discount codes floating around), and Shannon will be there, which is a big selling point! But, it's inaugural, and that makes me nervous. This is the furthest out, so I'd have more time to train, BUT it's the furthest out, so there's more time to train..... Anyway. I'm waffling. Of course, there's also Tinker Bell Half in January (!!!!), and a potential March marathon - 2 weeks before the ultra, so it would be a good last training run. I feel like I could pull out a giant marathon PR, so I'm considering Diamond Valley Lake Marathon in early March. Looks like a potentially boring course, but my options seem to be pretty limited (unless I go with Surf City, which I'm not excited about AT ALL). PLUS..... I'm also on the hunt, KIND OF, for a racecation.... maybe? Phew. That was a lot of race talk. What's on your calendar?]] The more I considered that race, though, the less I wanted to make that my "A" race. I just wasn't excited about it. It's not super great for PR'ing, and I didn't want to shell out the money for a fun run (for whatever reason, this race is far more expensive than any others in December). I picked a different, earlier, race for my goal race, and adjusted my training plan. After CIF prelims, when I really believed we would be going to states for #1 to run, I decided that since my next choice in half's was not going to work out..... hey, why not try to PR for real at the Renegade Santa Run ?? Look at this fun medal!! You can use "HEATHERDISCOUNT" for a discount! So, last week, even though I posted a half training plan week, I decided Monday afternoon that Santa Run 5k was my new goal race. If I could PR there, I had top 3 in my AG (based on last year's results) in my sights. That might be fun! I adjusted my training plan again, and added a lot of interval work - I'd been doing a lot of longer intervals and tempo runs, so I threw in a bunch of 400s and 800s instead. I know, I know, I retired from 5k's immediately following the Veteran's Day not-quite-5k, but I get confused. Since suddenly, the 5k was my focus, I did the 400s last week, and nailed it - all at my goal pace wheeeeeee so faaaast! . Anyway. Then we found out we weren't going to states, after-all (pride goeth before the fall, sorry, girls, I blame myself), so the half I thought was out, was suddenly back on the table! I had one last "long" run that I left on my plan juuuuust in case , so I set out Sunday to do it - 8 miles, middle 4 at goal pace. This should have been easy, breezy. how I felt after. I got through a mile warm up, 3 pace miles, and just stopped. I felt fine, I just didn't feel like doing any more. And now, it's Tuesday, 5 days before my supposed goal race, and... I kind of don't feel like it? I looked back over my training log, and my last long run was 14 miles back on November 14 - so it COULD count, and just pretend I've been on an extended two week taper? I just feel like a loser-pants, to let one lack-luster "long" run decide that I'm not even going to bother. I'd still really like to get a real 5k PR, so I'll keep working on that in the meantime, but to recap... maaaaybe I'm running a half this weekend, but MAYBE NOT. Oh, the suspense. ]] National Veterans Day Run in Irvine. The race was pretty small and low-key. Since it was close by, I used the run over to the race as my warm-up, and tossed in some strides on the way. The race started a few minutes late, with a pre-race Veterans Day ceremony just before.... The course starts with a loop through Woodbridge Community Park, then out and back on the bike path (my nemesis from the PCRF training days....), and another loop through the park back to the finish line. So, here's the real details on the race: The course is not marked. There are volunteers telling people where to go, but there was one missing, for example, at the first loop through the park, so we went the wrong direction for about 50 feet - there were left-over arrows on the ground from TNT training over the weekend, so it was confusing. The volunteer at the 5k turn-around, I think, had us turn too early - there's a section on the path (if you're familiar, I'm talking about the bike path between East Yale Loop, and Jeffrey) with two bridges - the volunteer had us turn at the first bridge, but I'm pretty sure it should have been the second bridge. Also, at the finish, I did not see any water, etc. Not a big deal for me, because it was cool this morning and there are water fountains at the park, just a note. BUT, it was really inexpensive (I paid $30 for a last minute registration), and included a pin, medal, and shirt. Plus, a portion of proceeds go to Folds of Honor Foundation , an organization that provides scholarships and other assistance to spouses and children of soldiers killed or disabled in service. You can donate to Folds of Honor HERE I'd rather run a low-key race with a good heart like this than fret about details and complain about stuff. Mostly, I wanted to get an idea of where I am with training, and if I have a reasonable goal for winter and spring races. With that in mind, my goal pace was around 8:50-8:40 (my 5k PR pace was 8:56, 27:47). The course measured at 2.74mi for me, and I finished with a 8:31 pace. WHAT. Mile splits:  8:34, 8:31, 8:31. If it were an actual 5k distance, and I managed to hold that pace (and I think I could?), it would be a 26:25ish finish. I was third female at the turn-around (there was a kid that was running the 5k that turned around before I did and cut the course a few times through the park loop, and finished just in front of me, so I'm not counting her, CHEATER). Small races are the greatest. Overall, I enjoyed the event - I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to freak out on the details, but for $30, it served it's purpose for me. Related, I've decided the 5k is not something I'm really interested in repeating. That isht is hard, yo. Give me a marathon, any day. ******************************************************************************* Plan for the week! To sum it up quickly, last week SUCKED. I just wasn't feeling the run love, not at all. So I didn't hit all of my miles. Oh wells. Taper for a 5k? HAHAHAHA. Monday : XT arms, core, pushups Tuesday : nothing Zippo. Wednesday : speeeeeeed, XT 2 mile repeats!! These sounded so scary, but then they weren't too bad. 1 mile warm up, 2x2mi, with 400RI, cool down. Goal pace was 9:11-8:59, actual was 9:09, 9:01. Felt good. Also did arms, and core. Thursday : XT Just pushups Friday : easy, XT 4 miles easy pace with strides; arms/core Saturday : FAILED long run Scheduled for 13 easy. Got through 5, felt crappy and achy and blah, and people wandered into the gym, so I called it a day and surrendered my treadmill. Sunday : rest I did absolutely negative zero things. Total: 15 miles. Oh well. This week: Monday : see above; 5 miles total for the day, with warm up/cool down Tuesday : easy or rest Wednesday : 7 miles strides Thursday : rest Friday : 15 easy Saturday : rest (we'll be at XC for the day) Sunday : 3-4 easy ************************************************************************* Cross-country update..... #1's team came in second in league finals Friday (#1 finished in 19:05, for 21st place!), so they're heading to state prelims next weekend!!! she fliiiiiies The girl's varsity team.... One of these things, is not like the other.... I'm really excited to check out the Mt Sac course, and all the fast fasties. I did some googling of the teams in her heat (is that creepy and/or weird?) for Saturday, and they should pull through to state finals for the following week. Just when we thought the season might be over......... There's a fair chance that they'll make it through to states, which is EXCITING. I can barely contain it; but race talk makes #1 nervous, so I'm trying to keep it all inside. Excited!!! We saw this shirt at the race Friday. It's funny, because IT'S TRUE. ]] Since I have alllllllll the free time on my hands, I did a lot of number crunching last week, building out fake-meets against our schools, and every way I played with the numbers, we were looking solid. Saturday, #1 woke up and was practically giddy. She was excited to run, and looked confident. The girl is a head-case runner - seeing her confident to go into this course was great. Spectating XC is an interesting day. The courses are short, usually 3 miles, and run so fast, that to spectate in a few places, you have to MOVE. Generally, there's a flood of spectators that flee from spot to spot throughout the course to catch their runners as they move through. Exactly like this.... If you've ever spectated a longer race before, it's exactly like that, but ON SPEED. The Mt Sac course is pretty loopy for the first 1.5mi, so you can kind of catch the athletes in about 4 locations before they head up the second half. We knew the layout from last week, and had a pretty solid spectating strategy, so we stuck with it (if you're interested, this is the course map - we planted ourselves at the end of the airstrip, before the loop, so we saw her at the start, on the first loop go around, then ran over to switchbacks, then to the crossover, and then to the gauntlet for the finish - I swear these are all things on the course that I'm totally not making up). Anyway. We're at our spot. The field takes off - 16 teams, 7 girls each team, plus individuals - and right away, I note that the field is tight, and FAST. It looks like our team is having some trouble sticking together in a pack, but #1 is looking good in her mid-pack position. source: Joe Gagnon/PrepCalTrack As we're waiting for them to come through the first loop, Sarah Baxter breeeeeezes through, well ahead of everyone else. Oh, look. She's winning! The lead pack comes through, and I start to get a little nervous - usually there's three girls on our team that start together, but they were not running together this time. Then the chase pack comes through - usually, #1 is solidly mid-pack, in here. And usually by now, the herd has thinned a bit - not so much this time. They're all still running really tight, and FAST. Then the girl that runs 7th for us ran by, and we thought we must have missed #1 in the herd. 15-20 seconds later, after everyone else has passed, is #1. My first thought, is she got frustrated with the pack, and was giving herself space? She always starts slow and then kicks in... maybe the fast start was too much. Maybe she wanted to give herself some room. And then I hear her breathing, and it's clearly distressed. I didn't connect what happened at first, until she was running past, and The H noticed the giant scrape under her right hip. Somewhere in the first 800, she had fallen. And my heart just sunk for her. We went over to the switchbacks, where she'd come through after the second loop around the field, and she was at the back, but was caught up to the rest of the pack (so, in the second 800, she made up 20 seconds on the rest of the field), and came through the first mile in 6:12. When she came by us, before heading up the switchbacks, she was crying, and limping. on Switchbacks Waiting for her at crossover was just THE WORST EVER. As her mom, I'm a pretty tough-love kind of parent, and generally defer to the coaching she receives from the XC team, but it was horrible, knowing how HARD running is, how hard running uphill is, and that she was doing it while crying and limping. She came through crossover, and had passed a few runners. After crossover, we planned to wait for her at the gauntlet (the last 200m at the finish), because the rest of the course is hard to get to and then still get to the finish. It was FOR REAL the longest longest longest 1.5 miles ever for me. She passed that girl in blue. When she crossed the finish line, I criiiiiied and cried. She finished two spots behind one of her teammates, and the other girls joined them in the line. After their bib numbers were collected, her teammates took her over to the med tent to get cleaned up, where #1 found out that they had finished.... 8th overall. Womp. She asked to stick around for the varsity boys' race a bit after hers, so we did. It was a pretty rough day. I'm not sure how she found it in her to finish the race, and finish it so strong. I tried to ask her why she kept running, and she just said "Because coach said to get up and go." Maybe it's that simple. I spent the rest of the weekend kind of coddling her, but she's been in a fair amount of pain - I don't think it's anything serious, just a lot of road rash, and bruising. Since they're not going to states, next week is an off week, anyway, so hopefully she's all healed up when they head back to school after Thanksgiving. She's had an amazing first season. It was really exciting to be a freshman, heading to CIF finals, and a great experience for her. Just kind of a sucky way for it to end. (PS, my number crunching was DEAD ON, and the team that ended up beating us into the finals was a dark horse that wasn't even ranked - they just had a killer day, and ran the race of their lives. Bad ass.  The team we were eyeing as competition TIED with us, and on a normal day, #1 would have been the tie-breaker, and would have beat their #6 runner. Maybe I missed my calling as a XC coach?) ]] First: Any local friends planning to run the SoCal Half Marathon ?? ************************************************** With 2 new PR's in December ( 5k recap here and half marathon recap here ), I figured there's nowhere else to go, so I should just quit running while I'm high, right? I took the last 2 weeks pretty much off. I was expecting to feel a bit sore and achy, but man alive, the first few days were rough. I did zero running until 6 days out, and finally felt pretty good then. I got SUPER motivated to hit 100 miles in December, and calculated that I would need, like, 36 miles in the next 9 days to do it. Last week, I ran a few more times, and did a couple days of cross training. I did not come ANYWHERE close to 36 miles, and... that's a-okay by me. Running double pr's was hard, man. I spent a lot of time baking things.... this was sticky bun test, take 2: Browned butter variation. This was a success! and skyping with family in Florida... #2 taking pictures of cousins = hilarious Losing teeth ewwww And some one-on-one time with each of these hoodlums. she's so cute sometimes. The H had to work on Christmas, so it was a really low-key affair around here, and I kind of liked that. I'm not a huge fan of big deals. I have a few for-fun races coming up this winter/spring... starting with Tink in 3 weeks with Becka , then the Renegade Coaster Run at Knott's in March! I may throw in a sprint tri in February , but I'm not sure yet (PS, for either of those you can register using HEATHERDISCOUNT for 10% off). I'm - still - on the hunt for a marathon. My travel budget is limited, we have some summer plans that are eating away my racecation budget this year - and none of the local races really speak to me. We'll see. I'd like to PR, but I want the right race. I'm weird. I also would kind of like to race another 5k and another half. Because I'm a glutton for punishment. #1's track season is starting up already (they started practice immediately following CIF Finals, crazy), and our spring Saturday's are pretty booked. HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS ARE SO SO SO SO TIME CONSUMING, you guys. I can only hope that #2 joins the same sports so we can be efficient with our time.  (I am kidding. Kind of.). In job news.... I'm still enjoying my funemployment, but I'm ready to get some stuff going. I've got some vague ideas swirling around, but they're like pieces to a puzzle that I'm kind of struggling to fit together. A friend of mine posted this the other day. Building the new. ]] Renegade's Santa Run is one of my favorites - fun crowd, well organized community event. Yeah, there are a lot of kids, but they are really well behaved and play nicely. This event is home to my current 10k PR, and (spoiler!) my new 5k PR. This year, #1 ran with me, instead of The H. We headed out at 7am for the 8am start, and parked down the street. This ended up being not quite enough time for us - we still had to pick up our bibs, and then hit the restrooms, and it just didn't give me time to warm up like I would have liked. Note to self, next year get there a bit earlier. I anticipated cool weather. HOWEVER, about 20 minutes before the start, it got freakishly HOT, and windy. The wind was hot . I don't know how else to explain it. It was not my most favorite, really. Anyway, the 5k course runs in kind of a figure-8 shape down the Peters Canyon trail... Like I sad last week, I had some goals for this race: A: 25:45ish, 8:18 pace B: PR - 27:38, 8:55 pace C: Don't puke and/or die Because I'm dumb, I did a long run last Sunday (15 miles), followed by a hard hard HARD speed workout on Tuesday, and nothing else. So that was pretty great and relaxing on the legs. The race started right on time, but because I was running late, I snuck in somewhere towards the front-ish, and hoped that it wasn't in the mix of kids running super fast. Mile 1 - 8:22. This mile felt good. I tried not to be overly concerned with my garmin numbers, and run on feel, and I felt like I could certainly sustain this pace. Mile 2 - 8:30. Well. That didn't last very long. This was at the turn around, and suddenly we were running into the hottest wind in the universe. Mile 3 - 8:54. This was terrible. Lol. Last .1 - 7:50. Out of the wind, THANK GOD. 26:27, 8:32 pace. Not too shabby, good enough for 5/60 in my age group! Look, it's me dying! for real, why do I do that with my head?! Anyway. It was hard, and hot, and hard, and windy. And hard. Running fast is hard. #1 also ran a PR, so it was a good day to be us. (Not so much to be Gabby, who melted down and couldn't wait to bail out of that race.). The race is really great, and we have really enjoyed the event the last two years. I was hopeful for an AG placing this year, but it was a bit of a faster field than last year - I think because the race is just growing a bit? The course is a little congested right at the start, before the turn onto the trail, but after that it cleared up a bit - this could just be where I ended up in the 5k, but I didn't have any trouble navigating. The course is a nice mix of mostly pavement, with some dirt trail the first half. I love dirt, so that's great for me. Registration prices start at just $25 for the 5k, $35 for the 10k, and $15 for the kids run - this includes a great medal and long sleeve cotton tee. so cute and sparkly! They have awards 3 deep in each age group, plus a costume contest - the costume was a big source of stress for me. I originally wanted to be a Christmas tree. After I constructed it, it was NOISY and JANGLY and would have made me insane. On my second trip to Target, I found some foam snowflakes, and a new costume was born. I spent Friday night sewing snowflakes onto my tank and Team Sparkle skirt, and was the hottest snowflake EVER. It was tons of fun, can't wait to tackle it again next year! ]] For the tl;dr version: This was a really hard race for me, the course kicked my ass, and I kept running until I finished, and PR'ed. On Sunday, I ran Holiday Half Marathon in Pomona. Margot , Monica and I drove up together, so I got to sit back and enjoy the pretty drive... The race has an 8am start at the LA County Fairplex in Pomona. It's a little hilly. The website notes, " The Pomona Valley is a naturally hilly landscape and while certain inclines could not be avoided, this course was designed to be as friendly to runners as possible." So, I knew it was hilly. I was hopeful that the nice weather would come back, but alas, it was warm and SUNNY. Since these are my 3 least favorite things - hills, sun, and heat - I was not super optimistic when we got there. On top of that, my legs felt.... kind of flat. I felt okay, but I sure wasn't feeling very peppy. I had cut back on my longer speed work over the last 4 weeks, to focus on shorter 5k efforts, so I wasn't sure my previous 2:05 goal was still reasonable. After a last-second bathroom excursion (real bathrooms!), Monica and I squeezed into the corrals as the national anthem was finishing up. I stuck to my spot between the 2:00-2:10 pacers.... Goal A : 2:05, 9:32 pace. This was kind of an arbitrary goal that I picked back in September. Goal B : PR, sub-2:11, 9:59 or under Goal C : Eh. If I felt just DEAD DEAD DEAD, I planned to circle back to a friend of mine that was running a slower pace, and run/walk with her and take pictures, pretending I was at Disney. When the race started, I tried sticking with the 2 hour pacer (WHY WOULD I DO THAT??) for a bit, but I thought she was just going too fast for me to sustain, so I dropped back before the end of the first mile. I realized pretty much right away that my legs just felt heavy. However, I also realized that they felt just as crappy running uphill as they did running downhill, so... pretty much, I just ran. I know that's a simplistic and ridiculous thing to even say, but since I was uncomfortable either way, I just went with it. I tried to run a consistent effort, and while I was checking in with my Garmin fairly regularly, I was trying to not let what I saw change how I was running. If it felt okay, I kept going. If I felt like it was a lot of effort, I eased up and let it happen. Pretty much the ENTIRE time, I was thinking: This is really hard. Keep moving your feet. This is REALLY HARD. Holy crap, this is so hard. I know I keep saying this, but for real, even the downhills I felt like it was all just so hard, because my legs were D E A D. The course loops around the fairplex, out into a park, back through some the fairplex, then loops through Bonelli park and around a lake from miles 3-11. You guys, I remember NONE of the lake, at all, and that's crazy, because... I ran around a lake for 7 miles. I don't even know what was happening around me. and yet, there it is. a lake. Anyway. I feel like the miles ticked by pretty quickly, and when I got to mile 8, I started doing some brain math to figure out how much cushion I had to still hit a PR. I knew 2:05 was out, but that was fine - I really didn't think that was in the cards in the heat/with the hills. I was feeling pretty tired, but it was no different than before, so.... I kept going. I was certainly slowing down, and my legs were even MORE dead, which I was surprised about, because I didn't know it was even possible. I knew at some point, there was a downhill to the finish, but I couldn't remember if it started at mile 11 or 12, so I was pretty sad when mile 11 felt HARD. Joke's on me, downhill started at mile 12. Margot - my running fairy godmother - jumped in with me around 12.5, and tried to run fast, but I had negative-zero kick left, and shuffled along behind her. Man. It was one hard-earned medal for me. Splits: 9:18, 9:51, 10:06, 9:25, 9:36, 9:33, 9:50, 10:12, 9:31, 10:08, 10:13, 10:03, 9:27. .2 8:49. 2:08:56 - Garmin measured 13.2mi, and 9:46 pace. After the race, I met back up with Monica, SR , and SR's friend Reese while Margot ran a few more miles, because she's an overachiever. And then we did the blogger-required things, like stopping at Starbucks and taking pictures of our food. Epilogue: I am really, really, really pleased with this race. I am still kind of surprised that it even happened. I didn't expect a PR, honestly, and I spent so much time thinking that I was REALLY uncomfortable, and being surprised I wasn't stopping. I was one walk break away from missing a PR, but I never really considered walking? Like, it didn't really cross my mind.  the 2:10 pacer passed me at one point going up a hill in mile 10, and I just let her go, then caught and passed her on the downhill. I don't know. Maybe this is some "mental fortitude" I have been missing in previous races? I've been having some issues on my recent long runs with - I'm guessing - my salt/dehydration/something like that. I am a reallllly salty sweat-er, and on my last 3 or 4 runs over 13ish miles, I've ended up with raging headaches for the rest of the day. I am a living-on-the-edge type of girl, so I tried a different fueling plan Sunday - margarita shot blocks every mile, starting at mile 3, and a salted caramel GU around mile 10-11. It was... okay. I don't know, I still felt on the verge of leg-cramping a few times, but I'm not sure if it was the salt/electrolytes, tired legs, or just hills. Anyway, the headache didn't happen, so I guess it's some improvement. There were supposed to be aid stations every mile after mile 5, but that wasn't really the case, and it was kind of frustrating for me to NOT have aid stations where I expected them to be, because I was timing my fuel. I mean, I am an obsessive type, and checked the website so I could be prepared, so it's annoying to not have the stations where they're advertised. Whatever. It's really a lame complaint, because there were PLENTY of stations, I just wanted them in specific spots I guess? lol. The shirts are really great - I LOVE it. I am lame and didn't take a better picture - this print is on the left side/bottom of the shirt. It was hot hot hot hot hot. I think mid-70's at finish? With an 8am start, it was pretty rough on me - I wilt in the heat. If the race had started an hour earlier, it would have been much better. A lot of the course is exposed, so with the bright burning sun, it was pretty horrendous. I really don't like hot/sun. Overall, it's a good race, and well organized. However, IMO, it's over-priced unless you register for early-bird pricing . A few years ago, I want to say I registered for this event for, like, $60 (and ended up DNS'ing). This year, when I thought about registering last month, I think it was $90? Thank goodness for a last-minute giveaway. The course is HARD. I know I went in with tired legs, but it is constant rolling hills. There are no flats. Monday, my legs felt pretty beat up - my quads, hamstrings, and glutes were UNIMPRESSED with all the things I did to them this weekend. But.... I'm curious what I could do on a friendlier course, so.... maybe a do-over is in order? Maybe. Or I could just retire now.]] last week, my brain is confused about what's going on with training. Let's recap my training/brain thoughts! Last week.... Monday : rest Tuesday : mooooore rest. Resting exhausts me. (Really, having the kids out of school made it exceptionally easy to laze around watching dumb tv with them). Wednesday : Speed - 5 miles 800s. They were fast and hard, but I (mostly) hit my paces. Goal was 7:50-7:24, actual was 7:53, 7:49, 7:47, 7:41. Thursday : Rest. 4 mile walk I felt SO GOOD after the 800's, I told The H I really really FOR REAL wanted to run the Saturday half. He mocked me. I forgot, does walking count as exercise?! We did some evening shopping at Target, and I had the genius idea to walk there - a 4 mile round-trip excursion. It was brilliant, until The H purchased a very large, fairly heavy item. Dummy. Friday : Rest again! Saturday : Pretend run. Got through 2 miles. I woke up truly excited to run. And then it was terrible. I quit. We bought donuts and sat around instead.Spent the day so grateful for The H's mocking, and happy I wasn't running a half on Sunday, because I don't even know if I can run that many miles any more I AM THE LAMEST WHY DO I EEEEVVVVEEEEEN TRRRRRYYYYYYYYY. It was dramatic. Sunday : Long run 12.1 really, REALLY great miles. I could have run faster, but wanted to keep it easy. I could have run longer, but there was a creeper in the gym. It was pretty much the greatest ever - how could it not be, with all of my favorite things. So, I didn't run the half. I've always kind of thought that I was NOT a mental runner - I thought I was pretty objective about things, don't let singular bad runs throw shade at my overall training experiences, etc. I think, maybe, I was lying to myself, lol. Without any real money on the line, it's really easy to just blow off training for something. Since I'm currently enjoying some funemployment time, my race budget is limited, and I want to keep it to real race efforts, or races I really, REALLY want to do. For whatever (probably made up) reason, I didn't feel like I was ready to PR this weekend, so I just.... didn't want to spend the money on the registration. Yeah, yeah, it's kind of a cop out. I know anything can happen on race day, but I'd rather feel good about my chances, I guess. I'm a safe gambler. ANYWAY. Blah blah blah, I was a headcase and didn't run a race. The Renegade Santa Race is in 2 weeks, so for the next two weeks, I'm maintaining focus on that as my "goal" race, because I really want that legit 5k PR - that means continuing the speed work. I'll still do a long run this week, though, because my eyes are on a plan B half at the end of the month. Maybe. HAHAHAHA. This week..... Monday : easy/XT Tuesday : 5 easy Wednesday : XT Thursday : speed - 10x400 (did you know 400s are my FAVORITE?!) Friday : easy/XT Saturday : easy/rest Sunday : Long (14ish) ]] 2. Which I'll wear Saturday for..... Where I hope to PR the 5k FOR REAL THIS TIME. I had a goal kind of picked out, and ran it by the smartest bunny I know , and since she thinks it's reasonable, I'm going to give it a shot. I have been doing a decent amount of speed work, and it's all been going pretty well. (My current *real* PR is 27:47 from July 2012; the Vet's Day race would have been a PR , but since it was not anywhere close to a real distance, I'm not counting it). My super lofty, man-I-hope-I-don't-puke goal: 25:45 (8:18 pace) Goal B is to just PR: 8:55ish pace I have no goal C. If I fail, I quit. JK, my C goal, as it always is in a 5k, is don't puke or die. #1 will be running, as well, and I tried to tell her it would be HILARIOUS to toe the line like it's a cross country race.... So far, she has declined. 3. Anyway, after Saturday's fun, I plan to try my hand at.... Yeah, yeah, I wasn't going to race this, but theeeeen I snagged a free bib from Run, Eat, Repeat , and now I'm going to! Yay, free. So after I got that bib, I thought..... man, it would be kiiiind of fun to PR TWICE IN ONE WEEKEND. Wouldn't that be FUN??? So, my goals for Sunday are..... A: 2:05, 9:32 pace. I honestly don't know that I'm in the right place for a 2:05 right now, because I've been doing shorter, faster runs in prep for the 5k. BUT WHO KNOWS! B: PR. My current PR is 2:11 (9:59 pace) from PCRF back in May 2012. That seems like BILLIONS OF EONS AGO. This wouldn't take too much effort, I don't think, but I have no idea how I'd feel on a hilly course the day after maybe running a 5k hard. So we'll see. C: If I get out there and a PR is just not in the cards, I'll run it easy and enjoy a long run with a friend. There are no losers here, so I'm sure it's going to be a swell day. Really, it's just been soooooo long since I've raced anything, I'm excited to be back out there and am really looking forward to all of it. ]] Dates seem sort of irrelevant to me. I don't like confining definitions to match a box in the calendar. I don't want to celebrate someone's life because we penciled their birthday into one of those boxes - I want to be excited they're here, every day. I don't love my husband more because that box says it's valentine's day, or our anniversary. When I think back about my life, experiences, the kids, my family, events I remember... most memories are pictures, they're experiences, and senses. I don't often attach a date to my memories. Just the feelings. January 1st is an exception. In 1999, I was young, and a little crazy and dumb, and sure thought I knew a lot of things. I was overdue with my kid #1, and was OVER being pregnant. We had picked out a middle name based on her Christmas-y due date - Noelle - and I was annoyed that it would no longer make sense, because we are now so far outside that holiday window. On January 1st, my husband and I went out for dinner. We didn't do it often, we were young and poor, but we did it that day. I'm sure I was throwing a tantrum of some type, and he put up with it and met my demands. We went to TGI Fridays by the local mall. I'd been craving buffalo chicken for the entire pregnancy, but had been avoiding it, because I was taking the spicy foods superstition to heart. On January 1st, I ordered buffalo chicken, because - what's the worst that would happen? I have a baby? Just like in the movies, I started having contractions, there in the restaurant. Unlike in the movies, it was non-dramatic, and I didn't even realize it until several had passed. We went home, started logging the contractions on a piece of lined notebook paper, and I spent the last hours of the first day of 1999 in the hospital, begging for an epidural, and finally getting one, but only because there were some complications. I remember thinking that none of this was going the way I anticipated, and not worried - just accepting - that there's nothing I can do about that. No amount of crazy-person pregnancy tantrums will change it. January 1st, 2011. I worked in e-commerce and holidays are always extra busy. I always look forward to January 1st, for the day off. Gabby had been fighting some sort of cold. She had been coughing, and couldn't kick it - the doctor wasn't too concerned the week before, even after small red dots popped up around her eyes (from small blood vessels broken during the coughs). I figured after a lazy winter break from school, she just needed to be pepped up, run around outside and get some fresh air. I spent January 1st, 2011, dragging her to any place I could think of - a park, where I made her climb up a small hill to get to the swings (she barely made it, and sat lethargically in the seat while I pushed her, before she asked to leave), the furniture store to look at new couches (where she practically fell asleep in the little car she was "pushing"), to Costco, where we didn't really need anything (where she actually DID fall asleep in the cart). Looking back now, I can see clearly that her lethargy had been progressively getting worse, that she was practically a shell of her normal, vibrant 4 year old self. At the time, in that day, it was an annoyance. I didn't have time for a sick kid, because we had a birthday to celebrate the next day. Sometime in the late afternoon, after all of my attempts to perk up the kid had failed, I took her to urgent care. An hour later, the ER doctor told us she was being transported to the oncology ICU, and that it was serious. I remember everything that happened, vividly, that night, and I remember being all at once annoyed that she was sick, dreading that it was something for real serious - maybe that's why I tried to avoid the doctor entirely? - and every time I thought back on the last few weeks with her, and had to recount her slowly progressing symptoms, ashamed that I had not stepped in faster, and concerned that someone, anyone who heard that it had been a few weeks of the cough, that she was lethargic for days, that she hadn't eaten and had no interest in food all day, that they were judging me as a terrible, neglectful parent. When I said all of those things together, out loud, it seemed ridiculous that I had just tried to heal her with a trip to look at couches. I could recount everything that transpired - I sent my husband home from the ER after they drew her blood, because I (still) didn't think it would be too much of a crisis, and we were right down the street from home - he had just gotten off of work, so I told him to go home and eat. My second call - to my cousin, after the ER doctors looked concerned about her blood work. We spent the last hours of the first day of 2011 in the hospital, with a vague "cancery" diagnosis. It was certainly not how I anticipated the day ending, but... what can you do. On January 2, 2011, we celebrated #1 turning 12 in the OICU, with a cake, that we shared with the residents and nurses, while Gab had her first lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsy. It's tricky to reconcile those memories. ]]  Continue reading  ]] Continue reading  ]] Continue reading  ]] Continue reading  ]] Continue reading  ]] Continue reading  ]] ]] Continue reading  ]] Continue reading  ]] Continue reading  ]]  ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] ]]  If you have ever dreamed of owning a racehorse there is truly no better time.

Thank you Joe Drape et al. Breakdowns, catastrophic, and career ending injuries, have long gone unreported to the general public unless captured on camera during a major broadcast. Thankfully, the NYSRWB has responded to this new found public awareness by making previously veiled industry reports readily available. The Equine Breakdown, Death, Injury and Incident Database , and the Racing and Wagering Board Ruling Database are new resources for owners to investigate trainers and make informed decisions. Had this information been available in the past, I for one, would have selected different trainers to handle my beloved horses. Over the past month, I have interviewed several trainers. I am abhorred by the number of prominent names who openly flaunt the rules by engaging in the debilitating practice of daily training on bronchodilators, pain-killers, muscle relaxers, and steroid-effect like drugs. Abetted by profiteering veterinarians, trainers erroneously believe these drugs give them an edge . Sadly, day-to-day training on drugs creates a dependence on DRUGS, the ones that are illegal on race-day! The problem with the use of training on controlled substances is that they mask the very subtle signs, symptoms, and pain that tell the educated eye its time for a change. They wreak havoc with horses own cellular intelligence which is designed to strengthen itself. Unnoticed, horses train onward only to collapse on race-day when their system hasnt the integrity to withstand the demands of racing clean. While researching within the NYSRWB database I was surprised by the number of cardiovascular collapses reported; the workload on heart and lungs must be enormous on an animal suffering withdrawal on race-day. Veterinarians addicted to profit, coupled with trainers addicted to finding an edge, are co-creating a generation of drug-riddled addicted animals. I see this first-hand as retired runners come to my farm for re-homing. Often, they go through weeks of withdrawal and depression while enduring the side-effects of long term drug abuse -- in the name of "therapy". Shockingly, trainers I have spoken with justify the use of illegal-to-race-on-drugs siting, that is what the other trainers do. Unfortunately, I too see veterinarians, who are entrusted to ethically prescribe, instead simply filling orders for trainers. To which I ask, what authority licenses trainers to diagnose and prescribe controlled substances? And yet, the veterinarians who supposedly control the controlled substances, by supposedly writing prescriptions and determining dosages are held to the same malpractice laws as human doctors. Furthermore, the misuse of drugs like Clenbuterol, is on the rise. Traditionally, a medication prescribed to clear up an inflammatory irritation, it is now being administered en masse for its anabolic steroid like effect . A finding noted and acted upon in California at Los Alamitos . As trainers and veterinarians fill horses with a continual stream of inappropriately classified therapeutic drugs such as clenbuterol, bute, banamine, magnesium sulfate , and naquasone...to name a few, they are setting up horses, and jockeys, for disaster. It is my belief, that the excessive amounts of controlled substances in use on a daily basis are causal to the rise in breakdowns -- this was alluded to in Dr. Susan Stovers in-depth report to Congress in 2008. On race-day, most entrants are given lasix, a diuretic that further insults the equine athlete through dehydration. Now, with comprised bodies suffering drug withdrawal the horse is asked to deliver its biggest most strenuous effort. It is my fear for the safety of all involved, that unless measures are taken to eradicate drugs all together, the lack of them on race-day will lead to even more casualties. If a horse is not allowed to race on certain substances, why then are they allowed to train on the same? This methodology implodes; each horse an innocent victim. The problem with racing is not race-day medications, the surface, or the purse.. .it is rather the willingness of certain people to exploit horses at any price. I have spent nearly everyday of my life in the company of thoroughbreds. I see no harm in racing strong, sound, healthy horses -- there is however, something seriously inhumane about drugging animals to  run through pain as one trainer put it, and,  because they need to race as a one veterinarian noted. It is my hope that NYSRWB will see fit to place a ban on all drugs, all the time, and regularly conduct drug testing on the backstretch in between races. Between now and then, perhaps the Board will revisit the 2009 plan to disclose drug records, a truly effective way to regain the publics trust. A proposal criticized only by veterinarians, none of which seem to have any difficulty with the same record-keeping when it comes to billing unsuspecting owners. By Susan Kayne.

Once accustomed to track routines, young horses bounce from stall to track like energetic Little Leaguers running from Moms car to the practice field. However, horses, like kids, will get bored if they do the same thing day-after-day. Science shows mental fatigue takes a toll on performance -- depleting even the most enthusiastic players. A bored horse will begin exhibiting vices from cribbing, weaving, and stall walking to a sour attitude. All work and no play is as tough on our four-legged friends as us. On the farm, UR horses work 6-days a week, on the 7th they frolic about the pastures from sunrise to dusk, as in todays video. Training on the farm is a more natural atmosphere for horses than at the racetrack. Lengthy walks to and from gallops, daily turn-out before and after works, and familiarity with other horses are akin to the comfort of home gym. Other than Fair Hill, most racing facilities dont have ample space to create paddocks, turn-out, or bridle paths. Rather they are built for efficiency to accommodate 1000s of horses and people getting on and off the track in about 5 hours on any given morning. That is the hectic pace we strive to prepare our horses to endure; it is a lot the equine mind to handle. Like our kids entering the real world work force -- it is scary, we worry for them, because we love them. The conflict for horse lovers like myself is that we know how much horses need their freedom to be happy and healthy. In my opinion, the next best place to the farm and Fair Hill, is surely The Oklahoma Training Track in Saratoga.The well-groomed Saratoga ovals provide pristine surfaces to attain the level of fitness necessary for racing, and the refreshing atmosphere rejuvenates the senses. Training hours, usually between 6AM and 11AM, dictate the protocol trainers must develop to get horses out for work, cooled out, and safely back in the shedrow. Adapting to nearly 23-hours-a-day in a stall is not easy for any freedom-loving animal. Such a life is in visceral denial of their desire to roam the range. Saratoga brings a balance to these opposing forces and even the most super fit equine athletes seem to take a deep breath and truly enjoy the rarified air between Union, East, and Fifth Avenues. To those on the NYRA circuit, Saratoga offers a reprieve from the logistical demands of functioning at a big city track. It is a mecca, for horses and humans. Every trainer I have interviewed emphatically states, horses love Saratoga, they blossom, they eat, they train better. Walking about the grounds, horses can be seen grazing in green spots, sauntering through big pines, and rolling and bucking in little turn-out pens adjacent to their quarters. Nick Zito has been training horses early each spring at the Oklahoma track for more than a dozen years, he told the Saratogian, weve trained Belmont Stakes and Jockey Gold Cup winners here. Now the words out. Its not a secret any more. Its probably the best training facility in the world. Clint and The Wild Girls will soon move from the life they've known for nearly three years on the farm, into their careers as racehorses. They love to run, and I believe they are prepared for the job ahead. Moving to Saratoga will be a big step for them, and the true test of our schooling at the farm. ]] Trainer calls for tighter control of medication in racing : PostStar.com - Glens Falls, Saratoga, Lake George NY area news A man after my own heart...Thank you Mr. Prine for speaking up for the well-being of thoroughbreds.

The purpose of the press conference was to  release the Economic Impact study conducted by the group which reveals that the horse serves as a "job creator" in New York and is responsible for billions of dollars of commerce. My question is... what does this mean for the horse...? New York will have a  huge number of unwanted horses in the state unless it FIRST addresses the drug abuse that takes place on racetracks and a comprehensive solution to care for horses bred in the state that have an average life span of 25 years after they retire from racing. Racehorses that are subjected to multiple injections and painkillers leaves most limited as to their usefulness in second careers. The reason being, chips, stress fractures, arthritis, tendonitis, and a myriad of other ailments that trainers and veterinarians refer to as "racing sound" will not equate to soundness for other less stressful disciplines. It is absurd that the same veterinarians that administer joint injections and painkillers for a horse to race, will not pass that same horse on a vet exam for a simpler easier life. It is a backward system leaving the innocent horse as its victim. The revenue from the VLTs that is increasing prize money and breeders awards serves as incentive to race unsound horses and breed without any measure of quality or control. Currently, 70% of the American thoroughbred crop ends up in slaughter....what is to stop this in NY? The reality is there is no effective aftercare program in place that addresses thousands of horses that fall through the cracks from the time they retire from racing.

I too am tuned in, but not with anywhere near the naivety or enthusiasm  I once had for horse racing ... Watching the Kentucky Derby -- the first leg of the triple crown -- 41 years ago ... I fell head over heels in love with the sport of kings as I watched a little brown horse from South America charge to victory in the 1971 Run For The Ros es . CANONERO II Some years later I had the joy of meeting the my TV idol Canonero II face-to-face at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, KY. During that visit I also met John Gaines , the visionary behind the Breeders Cup we see today. My family owned shares in stallions at Gainesway including my personal favorite, the late great EXCELLER -- a victor in major stakes over the Santa Anita Course with Willie Shoemaker in the irons. Later in his life a casualty of slaughter. Repeat visits to Gainesway and the surrounding iconic farms solidified my resolve to spend my life with thoroughbreds. I thought the career of a trainer or veterinarian to be noble pursuits....both front line caregivers..to the most beautiful creature on earth. Seeing thoroughbreds living at glorious bluegrass farms impressed me as to how well horses were treated..., and why wouldn't they be? Look at the amazing lifestyle they afforded their owners. I was young, naive, and quite impressionable. What I didn't know  then... I know now. Never in my worst nightmare did I imagine that which I have recently learned people will do to horses. In my own zeal to share the "good" about racing  I brought you interviews with top racing people that I really, really believed had the best interest of their horses at heart. In the years since then I have learned, first hand, quite the opposite....and for that my friends, I apologize. I believe adults should hold themselves accountable for failure. Owners and trainers willing to sacrifice horse care for the sake of a win, or ship a horse out-of-state to an unknown destiny have contributed to an overwhelming problem in the racing world.... the grotesque and inhumane butchering of Americas  thoroughbreds. Many related in pedigree to the magnificent horses we see gracing our TVs today at the Breeder's Cup. Whether dying on the track or in a slaughterhouse, the fact of the matter is -- the majority of American thoroughbreds are sent away on long torturous trips over US highways to Mexico and Canada. Terrified in a foreign land their skull is crudely fractured and their sinewy bodies hung  upside down by a hind leg to bleed out. According to USDA inspectors, some are still alive while being cut apart. Rendering and processing it is not  it is an excruciating, horrific death . The journey begins in the breeding shed and ends at an auction -- ALL on American soil. In my opinion .. if not acknowledged, addressed and  rectified with real solutions --- this will be the end of horse racing... and so it should be. Overbreeding is the genesis of this train-wreck, and excessive drugging at the racetrack piles on even more innocent victims. Recently among them, RAVISHLY, a resident NY mare , owned throughout her career by IEAH Stable who purchased her for $75,000 as a two-year-old. RAVISHLY did all that was asked of her on the racetrack and in the breeding shed. Upon retirement from the IEAH broodmare band, she became a "giveaway". No protection, no PENSION, no follow-up, and compounding the offense .... no names. RAVISHLY at SARATOGA GLEN FARM RAVISHLY was butchered the morning after she sold for $50 to a meat packing plant through an auction in Unadilla, NY. The same NY promoting and incentivizing more breeding without an effective and safe retirement plan for its equine participants. RAVISHLY produced five foals for her owner IEAH. As the breeder, they may collect state-bred awards up to 30% of prizes earned by each offspring. WHAT A NICE RETIREMENT FUND THIS COULD HAVE PROVIDED FOR RAVISHLY. California-based Deborah Jones revealed the plight of RAVISHLY on her facebook page, " emaciated, and injured from barbed wire, Ravishly was once again wearing a hip tag but this time there was no announcement promoting her bloodlines, progeny, race earnings not even her name.... known ONLY as hip # 0715 ". Deborah Jones is a first-responder on the front lines in kill pens. She saves dispirited and forgotten horses from the ultimate betrayal. Each of whom were once the apple of someone's eye. Now Deborah is their only hope. Journalist Joe Drape featured the work of Deborah Jones in Friday's edition of the New York Times. She is a hero to every horse on death row and to those who do truly love thoroughbreds. So, on racing's biggest day, as winners celebrate their new found millions and championship honors, I mourn for the hundreds-of-thousands left in their wake. May there be a heaven for horses, Susan.

About 15 years ago, I was thrilled to own a broodmare out of a half sister to Dutrows claimer turned Grade One millionaire KINGS SWAN. In 1987, I had horses with Bobby Frankel in New York. At the time, Ricks older brother Anthony was Frankels assistant. I lived in Manhattan, so I spent five mornings a week at Belmont Park, not only to see my horses, but to explore the wicked crush I had on Tony. I never really got to know Rick except through brief social encounters, usually on a late-summer night in Saratoga. I have stayed current on his exploits through the press. John Sabinis hubristic quote in the New York Times compelled me to write this post. John said, the courts action confirms that cheaters who repeatedly violate the rules have no place in New York racing.  Really?! One look through the NYSRWB Equine Breakdown, Death, Injury and Incident Database and Racing and Wagering Board Ruling Database shows dozens of trainers with multiple violations racing every day. The simple bureaucratic fact is that NYSRWB investigators pick and choose who to go after. Obnoxious and arrogant personalities are easy prey, whether guilty or innocent, their big mouths help investigators. When it comes to enforcing its rules, the NYSRWB acts as investigator, prosecutor, judge, and jury. How does the same agency perform all four roles? Dutrow, and his alter-ego Lou Pena in harness racing, are long time rule breakers. Had they each been served with bigger fines and longer suspensions for previous offenses I probably wouldnt be writing this post. So, why didnt NYSRWB deal with this matter more effectively years ago? Why werent both charged criminally under the anti-cruelty statute? The offenses fit the statute. And, why arent all trainers investigated with the same vigor NYSRWB utilized to nail Dutrow and Pena? I do not condone the abuses of Dutrow or Pena.Their actions are unconscionable. Drugging an innocent creature for financial gain is SICK, it is an ill of the human condition, a stain upon what is left of the sport of horse racing and an insult to any genuine horse lover. There will never be integrity in racing until the State, along with every industry participant, comes to recognize the well-being of each individual horse as a precious life and partner from which its own power and authority are derived, and treats each with respect and dignity. That being said, I find the selective sanctioning by the NYSRWB just as offensive, and that is why I find Sabinis statement so disingenuous. Dutrow never claimed innocence in the violations against him, instead, his defense has claimed that the process was biased against him and there were significant conflicts of interest. Dutrow is suspended is because an investigator chose to focus his time and energy on Dutrow. It was common knowledge among insiders that Dutrow juiced -- and so it is with many of the leading trainers. Cheats are light-years ahead of drug tests, and Lasix provides the perfect cover for oxygenating, pain-killing concoctions. In February of 2012, I presented the NYSRWB with original signed treatment records by a long-standing, well-respected equine practitioner on the NYRA circuit confirming illegal drugging. Documents clearly show nine instances of a trainer violating 4043.2 (e, g) (7) which could add up to $225,000 in fines and untold days banned from the shedrow. The trainer has a history of drug overages, so the infractions are not out of character, the offense is ILLEGAL DRUGGING, equal to the wrongdoing of Dutrow and Pena. The trainer in question is a friend of the NYSRWB investigator assigned to the matter -- so is it any wonder the investigator refuses to sanction his friend?! This is an example of the type of cronyism crippling New York racing from ever eradicating deceit in the Sport of Kings. In February [2013], the NYSRWB merges with the NYS Lottery under the Gaming Commission. What then my friends? Who will look after the horses? Id value your thoughts, please share your comments. Posted by Susan Kayne]] Susan Kayne, The Horses Advocate Thank you Rob Rubsam About Town! Unbridled Racing was another. Created as a means of providing investments in thoroughbred horses to those who would normally be priced out of such things, it also allowed Kayne to keep a hand in the horses she bred, guaranteeing their post-racing careers in showing. Originally based out of Greene County, the operation was moved to the Clermont Farm in Tivoli several years ago, so as to use its indoor track and birthing stalls, as well as to take advantage of its proximity to the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. But Unbridled Racing recently ended as a commercial entity. When I conducted this interview in November, Kayne said that she was only fulfilling a few more obligations before closing her doors, and several months later the website is down, and URs official Facebook page lists it as a "former partnership," though she has started a blog meant to discuss issues with horse racing. Which leads to the strongest, and most recent, of Kaynes passions: animal activism. In her view, drug culture on racetracks, particularly in New York, has gotten out of hand, and she cant contribute to a system like that by breeding horses into it.

From 2001 through 2003, Goldfarb was the leading owner by wins in New York. Handsome, rich, and on top of the game ... Sandy had the reputation of rock star on the NYRA circuit. I sat in the shedrow reading a narrative when a big black stretch limousine emerged from the morning fog. Slowly it negotiated backstretch bumps and holes until settling onto an almost level patch of dew-covered grass alongside the old track rail. Parroting Ed McMahon, Castle hollered , Heeeeeeres Sandy! My heart raced, and my hands got clammy; I really wanted Sandy on the show. His status and big name could drive viewership skyward. I was elated when he agreed. He gave a great interview for Unbridled, and we have since developed a long-standing friendship. The Sandy I have come to know is kind and generous, and he sure is nice eye-candy! In early December 2003, Willy gave me a heads-up that Sandy was planning to retire his beloved racehorse Stalwart Member. Willy asked, Would you be interested in taking him? Sandy really wants to do what is right for this horse. Up until this particular call, my answer had always been an instant YES! I always had a farm with an open stall and soft spot for thoroughbreds. I had retired, retrained, and re-homed dozens of racehorses by way of calls from Castle. His call was business as usual, but my answer was not. At the time, I was in-between farms, recently divorced, and had my own horses boarded out. I was at my monthly limit, actually over it -- way over it. It was a tough time. I explained my circumstances and asked Willy to give me a day or two to figure something out. He quipped, as only a close friend can, Well, you better think fast. Sandy is going to announce this to the press. Sandy wanted a good home for his horse, and I wanted to help. I could not afford to board another horse so I pitched Sandy on the idea of putting up the next six months board at a local stable, and I would assure a safe transition for Stalwart Member.  I made the case that $500 a month at a farm is far less than $5000 a month at the track, and it was the least he could do for a horse that had given him so much. It was a win-win-win. Sandy put his money up and Stalwarts off-the-track journey began. Stalwart in the news... On December 13, 2003, The New York Post reported: Leading thoroughbred owner Sanford Goldfarb announced in the paddock before the Big As first race, Win or lose, this is the final start for Stalwart Member, as a ten-year-old he deserves an easier life, he is sound and fit and that is how every horse should exit his or her racing career. Goldfarb fondly recounted, For three years Stalwart Member has been like a member of our family, he has brought us thrilling races and many victories. He has a lot of life in him, and we look forward to following his progress with Susan Kayne as he acclimates to life outside the track. On December 21, 2003, The Daily Racing Form headlined: Stalwart member retired at age 10 Writer Karen M. Johnson, daughter of the late great trainer P.G. Johnson, recounted Stalwarts popularity on the New York circuit. Goldfarb reiterated the importance of retiring Stalwart while he is physically sound, He is such a special horse: you cant measure his heart, he always wanted to win. When he saw a hole he would go for it. He gave his life to the game, and he deserves this retirement. I broke the news upstate on Capital OTB (Time Warner Albany Channel 12) on Sunday morning while co-hosting the days racing analysis with well-known handicapper Anthony Mormino. Racing fans sent dozens of emails wishing Stalwart green pastures and happy days ahead. Moving a racehorse from a near-decade of life in a stall to the expanse of a farm is culture shock, especially for a track-savvy boy like Stalwart. He was accustomed to a very regimented routine; aside from racing, his outings were limited to morning gallops. Meeting Stalwart... On Tuesday, December 16, 2003, Brookledge Horse Transport delivered Stalwart to his new home at Double B Farm in Clifton Park in a huge, luxurious, eighteen-wheeler air-ride tractor trailer! He must have thought he was headed to Saratoga  but it was winter! Unloading in the brisk air, Stalwarts nostrils flared. He snorted and pranced, tap dancing around me with his head held high like a giraffe. His deep brown eagle eyes surveyed the lay of the land. He was oblivious to the chain over his nose and hard to keep in hand. Swiftly and gingerly, I guided him into his new stall. It was a relief to secure him in a safe space. Quizzically he wiggled his nose into the shavings. Accustomed to straw, he investigated this strange matter. Hed dig, sniff, and then curl his lip in the air. Finally, he rolled. Covered with pieces of white pine he beckoned for the attention of his new neighbors by twisting and shaking his head. The big bay warmblood across the aisle momentarily glanced in his direction, and the old, fat, grey pony peaked though a crack in the wall while continuing to feast on his pile of hay. A fellow rider passed by with, Awwww, look at him. He is so sweet; I cant believe he came from the track. On her way back she reached through the stall bars and scratched his forehead. Stalwart was sweet...most of the time. Feeding Stalwart the Race Horse The first time I fed Stalwart, he nearly knocked me over as he tried to bury his face in the metal grain scoop. His warm breath felt good, but his overactive mandibles sent grain flying everywhere. Pushing out his snout, I made my way to his big feed tub in the corner. I poured in the hot bran mash first and topped it with the remaining grain in the metal scoop. As fast as I put food into the tub, he pushed it out! Stalwart needed a real racetrack-style grain dish, the Dans or Thybens type with a feed saver ring. Within minutes, more grain lay on the floor than in the tub. He had had a long day filled with big changes. I talked to him while stroking his rock hard neck; it was the most densely muscled neck I had ever touched. There you go boy, I whispered. Emotion swelled as I thought about his journey, all that he had seen, and all of the different stables he had been through. No doubt he dealt with a lot of different people throughout his career  each seeking to get something for himself via his racing ability. Most thoroughbreds are only worth what they can earn at a given time. Stalwart was lucky to have had Sandy. Leaving the stall, I turned around for another look at this amazing horse. I was greeted by his mouthful of amazing ten-year-old teeth in my face --- YIKES! Was I startled! This was not the sweet boy I just left noshing on hot bran mash! My compassion turned to self-preservation. He reinforced his message with ears pinned back. I changed out his dish and fed him through the door in the wall for the next few months! In the months to follow, scary-monster-horse-to-feed became satiated. Stalwart settled down and let down. Savage feed time behavior turned to solace as Equine Senior satisfied his ravenous appetite. His body began transitioning from lean and sinewy to fat and shiny. Quite frankly, I was shocked at how quickly he was transforming. Turn-out His initial turn-out was in the inside. It was December, it was cold, and he hadnt been turned loose in nine years. He seemed stunned at first. Hed stand and buck in place while adding a front leg strike and neck twist. Once he realized he really was free of a lead shank, he took off and frolicked in every inch of the indoor arena as if it were his own personal sand box. By March [2004], Stalwart was ready to be turned out in the fresh air. First into a small pen, and then within days he graduated to larger spaces. Eventually he went into a big paddock with friends. For such a fierce competitor on the track, he was quite affable with pasture mates. He loved his outdoor turn-out...I did not. You see, Stalwart was a mudder on the track. He searched for and wallowed in anything resembling mud. If one puddle could be found in the paddock, hed dig it into a personal pond. Somewhere in the archives I have a picture of him with only his two eyes recognizable, the rest of him covered in a coating of dry, caked mud. I spent hours cleaning up the boy, only to have him do it again. His antics sent me straight to Riders Crossing for a Rhino-tough turn-out blanket by Horseware Ireland. It helped a little. Without fail, any part of Stalwart left uncovered was thick with earth. Riding Stalwart ... Stalwart was surprisingly easy-going to ride considering his lengthy career on the racetrack. The first time, and every subsequent time I sat on him, he was steady. He never felt like he was going to seize the bit and run-off. The first few weeks under saddle he was stiff and muscle sore like most OTTBs, but he was not lame. His legs puffed as anti-inflammatories and racetrack drugs left his system. Within a few days of his arrival, I started him on a course of joint supplements, Thia-Cal [Finish Line], SOURCE, and Guinness [the beer!]. His body responded, and he loosened up and became quite flexible. By March [2004], he was like a rubber band, stretching, and fluid. It was time to find Stalwart a new home. I had grown quite fond of Stalwart; he had a big heart under his wily exterior. On April 4, 2004, Stalwart was adopted by Heather Brandt, a young woman with a passion for thoroughbreds. She had the background and skill set to develop Stalwarts potential as a riding horse. Time Warner News Channel 9 covered Stalwarts move to Brandts Flint Wood Farm in Ballston Lake, NY. There again he made new equine friends with several other horses under Brandts care. Brandt aptly referred to Stalwart as Second Chance. With consistent work Heather helped Chance to understand the nuances of English riding. She improved every aspect of his work under saddle and regularly reported on his progress. He has shown a remarkable difference and has adjusted well to his new surroundings, and he is working well on both canter leads. Heather kept me abreast of Chances progress. Photos showed a filled out, happy, and relaxed horse. My heart melted. Stalwart fast became a favorite again, this time with riding fans. Heathers students loved the horse they knew as Chance. In many instances he was their only chance to ride. She refined Stalwart into a safe and solid teacher. He loved his job. As Heathers reputation grew, so did the waiting list of retiring thoroughbreds looking for a stall in her barn. Stalwart would need to move to make space for another thoroughbred in need. It was bittersweet when Heather made arrangements for Stalwart to move to JHA Riding Academy, a reputable local lesson and show stable. His steady stride gave many JHA kids confidence in the saddle. He spent one year in the JHA lesson program. Stalwart was purchased privately from JHA. Heather and I tracked and followed his every move; good reports indicated he was happy and healthy. Then, a sudden hiatus in communication alarmed us. Something was wrong. It turned out that Stalwart changed hands a few times. Heather provided leads, I investigated. After many calls and emails I learned in September 2006, that Stalwart was with Dr. Amy French, a veterinarian from Johnstown, NY. On the day I made contact with Dr. French, I learned that she was shipping Stalwart to a livestock auction at JP Norths, a place I have known to be frequented by kill buyers over the years. I was angry and horrified. Keeping my cool and making a deal and get Stalwart home safe was the only option. Since Stalwart moved to Heather in April 2004, I now had a farm, and it was within ten miles of the auction. I arranged to pay for Stalwarts shipping and then some. I did not know any of the people with whom I was dealing, and each had a conflicting story. How he ended up with Dr. French is unclear to this day. Finding him in the nick of time was nothing short of a miracle. The sketchy details of Stalwarts whereabouts over the past few months left me uneasy as to whether Stalwart would actually be shipped to me or not. Then, I began to wonder if the horse being shipped was really going to be Stalwart. The confluence of events leading to Stalwart's return troubled me for the next several hours. I hoped for the best. Late in the afternoon a shoddy stock trailer sped into the driveway. Stalwarts white star and stripe were visible between the rusted slats. Tied in the rear, he was easy to get to. The rear door creaked open and there stood a skeleton of the horse I knew. Urine-soaked manure squished under my boots. The slippery footing made it difficult for Stalwart to maneuver. His weary legs trembled as he inched his way out. Helpless eyes of other innocents headed to JPs glanced out in angst. I was filled with despair; I wished each was unloading with Stalwart. Nothing good awaited them at JPs. My heart sank. Stalwart looked dreadful; he was dispirited and emaciated. His hip bones protruded like a clothes hanger, his skin stuck together, his mane and tail sunburned, and his heels horribly under-run. I was sick at the sight before me; I could not believe he had been in the hands of a veterinarian for the past few months. He looked like he hadn't eaten in six months. I have always maintained an open return policy for horses I have re-homed.  This is in writing and transferred on to successive owners. Horses are very expensive to maintain. Sometimes circumstances change and people cannot afford the upkeep. It happens, but the horse(s) need not suffer. Over the years a small percentage of horses I have re-homed have returned. A few phone calls and networking online averts a potential crisis. This was the first re-homing that went horribly wrong.  It reminded of a story I just read about on Larry Ensors site. Thankfully, he, like me, was able to intervene. It was time to forgive, give thanks he was alive and not slaughtered, and begin to revitalize this very lucky horse. Mortified, I called Sandy, and explained what had happened. Sandy, unfazed  stepped up and contributed funds to help Stalwart  again. Goldfarb had claimed Stalwart Member for $35,000 as a seven-year-old in 2000 and won several races and graded stakes with him on the New York circuit including the Grade III Sports Page Handicap November 2001. Stalwart also has the dubious honor of having been the very first stakes winner for now ten-year suspended trainer Richard Dutrow. Competitive to the core, Stalwart Member scored a number of stakes wins in addition to twice winning the Sports Page [1997, 2000]. To this day he is on record for the fastest win the Hollie Hughes Handicap. In 1997, he topped the field and equaled the track record at Aqueduct for six furlongs in 1:08.64. Later that same year, he headlined the New York Times Sports section when he won the MacArthur under 123 pounds on opening day at Belmont, and closed out the year winning the Gravesend Handicap (G3) at Aqueduct.  Overall, he won seven stakes and placed in six other stakes, including a runner-up finish to Langfuhr in the 1997 Carter Handicap (G1). Bred by the late Edwin Wachtel, Stalwart retired with eighteen wins in sixty-four career starts and earnings of $783,807 as one of New York States top New York-bred earners. Sick and tired of seeing an unbelievable number of horses breaking down, Sandy chose to send his warrior out with dignity: He loves his job, but we knew it was time for a career change. Wouldn't it be nice if all owners followed this example? By late fall 2006, Stalwart regained his strength and began adding weight to his big bony frame. Lots of Equine Senior, hay, and supplements expedited his safe recovery. He was enjoying life, and he had a new fan club in my nieces and nephews, Lizzie, Kayla, and Matthew, and Sheila Watts, a delightful young girl who took lessons at our farm. In early 2008, I began seeking a forever home for Stalwart. I interviewed many prospective adopters. The majority were unsuited to look after a thoroughbred. Then came an enthusiastic brunette connected to a good solid stable. She was looking for a horse of her own to get back into riding. I was shocked when Erin Looman said, Yes, I will take him. Many in her position would have opted for an older quiet, non-thoroughbred.  Stalwart hit the lottery. For the next five years, Erin gave the Stally the best years of his life. She kept him in fine style at the beautifully maintained and managed Hillcroft Stables where together they learned, loved, and struggled. Stally was Erins prince, she went through hell and high water to keep Stally in the best of care at all times; rough patches that would have caused others to give up did not deter Erin. Honest to core, Erin kept in touch and frequently sent photos and updates on Stally. . In late 2012, Erin moved Stally to yet another local palace, the newly revitalized Windrunner Stables. Nearing twenty, Stally began to experience aches and pains. His limbs grew stiff as ringbone advanced and spavins set-in. Erin updated me on veterinary findings, and I knew for a horse with the heart of Stally, standing around was not an option. He lived to run. Every fiber of his being embodied his magnificent stride. On April 3, 2013, I received a note from Erin, On Sat., 3/30/13, @ 3:00, my boy Stally crossed the bridge to greener pastures. Her message was short. I understood the raw emotion and inability to speak of putting a friend to sleep -- it is excruciating beyond words. Just days before I learned of the passing of Stallys mother, Ms. Stalwart, at Our Mims Retirement Haven on January 28 due to complications of old age. She was twenty-nine. Later, Erins facebook post spoke to each of us who has loved a horse: I would like to thank everyone for their kinds words. Many made me smile through my tears. Stally for some was a machine, a money maker, to me he was a living, breathing creature who had more heart than some humans I know. He was my boy and will be missed every day. # # # # RELATED LINKS: Daily Racing Form Stalwart Member Retires BLOOD HORSE Stalwart Member Retires BROOKLEDGE HORSE TRANSPORT HEATHER BRANDT'S STABLE JHA RIDING ACADEMY HILLCROFT STABLES STALWART MEMBER PICTURES [FACEBOOK] STALWART MEMBER'S PEDIGREE STALWART MEMBER'S RACE RECORD STALWART MEMBER ETR IN HOLLIE HUGHES, AP, March 2, 1997 NYT [Sept. 6, 1997] WIKI History of The Sports Page Handicap Stalwart Member Win Chart August 14, 2000 at Saratoga Stalwart Member Win Chart Sept.8, 2000 at Belmont Park EDWIN WACHTEL OBITUARY Ms. Stalwart Obituary # # # # ]] Soledad OBrien buys 2nd Akindale OTTB ]] In 1986, I was a naive, horse-crazy 18-year-old living in Manhattan focused on a Wall Street career.  I spent Monday through Friday at Eisenberg Sons learning to trade options and understand things like arbitrage. The weekends were reserved for my true loves  Aqueduct, Belmont, and the Meadowlands, the trio enveloped my every upright moment. On Saturday and Sunday, I traded stock charts for RagozinSheets . This was also the year I put together my first racing partnership. The horse, a stunning gray son of Graustark , the trainer Bobby Frankel. Jerry Castle, father of my dear friend Willy, recommended Bobby. Mr. Castle, was a leading owner in the 1970s with the notorious Buddy Jacobson , and later Jose Martin .  Willy, now goes by William. He is the agent for jockey David Cohen. Bobby Frankel had apprenticed with Jacobsen [father of David Jacobson ].  Castle knew Frankel well. Sounded good to me, but, seriously -- how is a California-based trainer going to train horses in New York?  Why Anthony Dutrow of course! Young Tony, brother to another notorious racing figure [Richard Dutrow], earned Frankels confidence and headed-up the New York division. My beautiful grey boy was front and center in the Frankel shedrow at Belmont Park [in my mind J ]. Really, the star of the time was Garthorn, aka the Believe It colt. In May [1986], Garthorn was prepping for the prestigious Met Mile at Belmont. Bobby was en route from California with owners Jerry and Ann Moss.  I was so excited at the thought of meeting Bobby Frankel in person. ? Tony introduced me to Bobby. Bobby was gracious and reserved, later I learned what a good mood he was in  lucky for me! I tracked Bobby to learn as much as I could during his weekend on the east coast. It was an unforgettable experience.... Garthorn won the Met Mile. Bobby, Jerry, and Ann invited me to join them in the NYRA Trustees room to celebrate with champagne and delectable hors douevres . I didnt know such a room existed at NYRA  wow, it was an eye opener. The celebration continued into Manhattan...limos, penthouses, fine-dining and drinks...until the wee hours of the morning. Bobby was a perfect gentleman.  Although, it didnt surprise me to learn years later, he was quite the ladies man. He was endearing and charming; he spent most of his time speaking about his daughter Bethenny. Ann was so sweet and so gorgeous, I believe she was a model before becoming Mrs. Moss. And Jerry, I learned was the 'M' of A M Records. Amazingly, we had a friend in common, New York music man Morris Levy . Zenyatta couldnt have happened to nicer people. It is funny how certain conversations rattle about in the mind for decades. ???Truly, it is like yesterday I remember Bobby sitting at the dinner table bragging on his daughter. She was 15 at the time. We were three years apart. It wasn't the age though, it was the name.  Bethany Blaisdell was one of my very best friends in grade school, she was the only Bethany I knew. When I first saw Bethenny Frankel , I saw Bobby; her beautiful smile and kind eyes are a gift from her father. Today [09.July.2013] is Bobby Frankel 's 72nd Birthday. Though he is not here physically, I will raise toast tonight and remember the good time he showed me in the Big Apple. In 2004, I officially interviewed Bobby for Unbridled TV . He candidly spoke about his rise to success, love of horses, and how he'd like to be remembered. I hope this post gives you pause to take a moment today to recall a win, a memory, good times, and happy trails with Bobby Frankel -- he was a good man, and he left us too soon....
