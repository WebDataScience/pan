 What is protein? How much protein do we need? Is it possible to eat too much protein? These are important questions for people who want to lead a healthy lifestyle. Protein is a very important part of our diet and can benefit us greatly if we get the right amounts. What is protein? Protein is one of the basic building blocks of the human body, making up about 16 percent of our total body weight. Muscle, hair, skin, and connective tissue are mainly made up of protein. However, protein plays a major role in all our cells and most fluids in our bodies. Also many of our bodys important chemicals such as hormones, enzymes and neurotransmitters and even our DNA, are at least partially made up of protein. Although our bodies are good at recycling protein, we use up protein constantly, so it is important to replace it daily. Proteins are made up of smaller units called amino acids. Our bodies cannot produce nine of the amino acids, so it is essential to include all these amino acids in our diets. Animal proteins such as meat, eggs, and dairy products all have amino acids, and many plants have some of them. Proteins from corn, grains, beans and vegetables tend to be of lower quality. That is why vegetarians or vegans need to get their protein from a variety of sources. How much protein do we need? The standard method used by nutritionists to estimate our minimum daily protein requirement is to multiply the body weight in kilograms by .8 or weight in pounds by .37. This is the number of grams of protein that should be the daily minimum. According to this method, someone weighing 150 lbs. should eat 55 grams of protein per day, a 200-pound person should get 74 grams, and a 250-pound person should eat 92grams. Is it ok to eat more protein than recommended? In a review of the research, the National Academy of Sciences reported that the only known danger from high-protein diets is for individuals with kidney disease. After careful study, they recommend that 10 percent to 35 percent of daily calories come from protein. They point out that increased protein could be helpful in treating obesity. There is also accumulating evidence that extra protein may help prevent osteoporosis. In conclusion, protein is an essential part of your diet and consuming the right amounts can help increase energy, weight loss and possibly osteoporosis.

Please RSVP. ]] So what is holding them back from seeking help and moving forward? Here are some of the reasons or excuses I have heard from people: I dont think I can do it Its too hard I cant afford it I dont feel like it I dont have the time We often do things based on feelings. If we dont feel like it, we dont do it, even when we know its healthier. If we can learn to focus on the consequences verses rewards of not doing something or doing something, then we are more apt to follow through. For example, I dont always feel like exercising, but I know its good for me and I will feel much better afterwards. This motivates me to exercise again, and I now love to do it! Many times we defeat ourselves before we even get started. Weve already convinced ourselves we cant do it so we dont even try. Setting our mind is one of the most beneficial things you can do. To set your mind is to determine decisively what you will think, what you believe and what you will or will not do. Determine that you will become healthier no matter what it takes and dont give up! I have seen many of my clients succeed when they at first lacked the confidence to even try. Once they started they got more and more confidence, while getting encouragement and support from the group and coach, which lead to their success. This wouldnt have happened if they wouldnt have taken that step of faith. I encourage you to take a step of faith and come to my next Transitions overview on August 23rd at River Valley Church in Martinsville. With faith nothing is impossible! ]] Because the roots of sugar addiction are both physical and emotional, you need a combination of physical and psychological approaches. The less you eat sugar, the less you will crave it. If you get withdrawal symptoms, know they will only last a few days and then you'll feel more balanced and energetic than ever. Here are some tactics that may help you break your sugar addiction:  Keep sugary products out of your house. Eat enough healthy food to satisfy your hunger. Eat snacks like fruit, carrots, red pepper, cherry tomatoes, dates, and dried fruit to satisfy your sweet tooth. Drink plenty of water, too. Frozen fruit, whole or pureed, makes a delicious alternative to ice cream. Once you have cleansed your system, your taste buds will become more sensitive, and these whole natural foods will taste sweeter and more satisfying.  Eat three regular meals each day that combine complex carbohydrates (vegetables, whole grains, and fruits), lean protein (poultry, fish, meat, dairy, tofu) and healthy fats (omega-3's, olive oil and other cold-pressed oils). This will help you maintain a steady blood sugar level throughout the day and reduce your sugar cravings. Also, eat a diet high in fiber which will help reduce sugar cravings.  Take a multivitamin and mineral supplement. Chromium picolinate and l-glutamine can help reduce cravings for some people.  Get plenty of sleep, sunlight and exercise which can help reduce sugar cravings.  Learn to identify whats causing your cravings. Many people turn to sugary foods when they are stressed, bored or tired. Instead, try exercising, meditating or doing something fun that you enjoy.  Be kind to yourself. To end the struggle with sugar, learn to nourish your body well and respond compassionately to your own feelings. In conclusion, addiction to sugar has lead to a variety of health problems such as obesity, hypertension, and heart problems to name a few. Overcoming sugar addiction is important if you plan to live a long, healthy life, and want your family to also. If youre serious, contact me about my upcoming Transitions classes where you will learn how to beat the sugar addiction so it doesnt beat you! ]] When I asked Margaret if it was ok to use her testimony, she was very excited because her passion is to help others overcome the obesity cycle and live life to the fullest. Here is what Margaret shared with me: I have lost 155 pounds and I have people ask me all of the time how I did it. Most assume that I had the stomach surgery; some think that I have discovered some magic potion that will help them too. The answer is not magic and it is not without change. Changing starts on the inside and then the outside starts to show the progress. It is a decision that you make with yourself and God to take care of your body. If I had a nickel for every time that someone said to me I would do ANYTHING to lose this extra 10 lbs, I would be rich. But when given the opportunity, you find that the statement anything has lots of strings attached. I wont eat vegetables or I cant survive without my chocolate. Before you know it, there isnt much that most people will change. I died slowly for years convincing myself that my diet was not so bad. I had a major wakeup call that caused my thinking to change. I made the decision to start taking care of myself. I decided to love and nurture my body and get the most out of life. I started working with Coach Irene Greiner on Transitions Lifestyle this year because she had the tools that I needed. She works with a plan that helped me to understand what my body needs and what things I should avoid and why I should follow that pattern. Now I design what I put in my mouth to give myself the best nutrition possible and I feel wonderful today! I took my girls roller skating yesterday and I skated right along with them. My resting days are over. Someday when I am called home I hope that instead of saying She just didnt take care of herself, they will say that I turned my familys life around. I am so glad that I stopped giving excuses to cover my lifestyle and decided to transition to a new life entirely with much prayer and much dedication. Margaret has been an inspiration to so many because of her hard work, commitment and perseverance! I hope you also will be inspired to Transition into a healthier lifestyle too! ]] How many times have you told yourself its time for me to start eating healthier and exercising? So many people talk about making a change but when the reality sets in on how much work it is they give up. They prefer to keep living their lives just as they are, even though they feel tired, stressed and out of shape. These questions may help you make an honest reality check: 1. Do you believe once you reach a certain size or weight, youll be happy? Have you said to yourself, Once I reach a certain weight Ill be happy. If so, what happens if you never reach that goal weight? Are you therefore, never happy? Or, if you do reach that magical weight, but then realize this has nothing to do with your happiness. Many people dont understand that the weight is only a symptom of the underlying problem. However, if you work on the true issue, youll be happier and much more likely to care for yourself so that your unhealthy lifestyle is no longer a concern. 2. Do you look for a shortcut or an easier approach to achieve what you want? It takes dedication, commitment, and perseverance to accomplish what is worthwhile. Hard work is necessary to accomplish anything that is vitally significant in your life. First, you need to determine why you want to accomplish a healthier lifestyle. Dont take the easy way out! Although, its tempting when hard work is involved, it will be worth the effort! 3. Do you frequently use excuses to get yourself out of doing what it takes to achieve your goals? So many people just want to talk about making changes but when it comes down to doing the hard work, they prefer to offer excuses as to why they continue to live as they are. Dont be a victim to your excuses! If you are making excuses you are not ready to make a serious change in your life. 4. Do you consider giving up when you experience minor setbacks? Everyone experiences struggles, but dont allow them to prevent you from pressing through. The best way to look at setbacks is to see them as challenges and a part of your progress. If you overcome them, and reach your goals despite of them, your ultimate sense of accomplishment will be much greater than if it was an effortless task. In conclusion, if you are living an unhealthy lifestyle, be honest with yourself about what you need to do to make changes. Dont be afraid of making the commitment to change, and dont just talk about it - do it! ]] Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the United States. Between 16 and 33 percent of children and adolescents are obese. The recent statistic in Indiana is 29.9 % of children are obese. Consequently, unhealthy weight gain can be contributed to lack of exercise and poor diet. Obesity often occurs in children due to overweight parents. Children who are obese usually become overweight adults - and the cycle continues! Changing family behaviors is crucial. Rather than singling out children the whole family must make healthy changes. Here are some helpful hints that can help:  Start small. Gradual changes are easiest to incorporate into your daily routine, and to maintain long term. Start by making a few small changes, such as turning off the TV during dinner, switching from soda to skim milk or water, snack healthy such as apples and peanut butter instead of chips and cookies. Take a family walk or bike ride after dinner once a week. Increase activity each week.  Set goals. Set realistic, measurable goals for each family member, and then establish family goals. For example, your child's goal might be to eat fruit for afternoon snacks. Your goal might be to take a brisk walk three days a week. The family's goal might be to limit fast-food meals to once a month.  Recognize triggers. Be prepared for situations that will tempt you to fall back into bad habits. If you're used to eating popcorn at the movies, only bring enough money for admission, or agree that you'll share a small carton of popcorn rather than ordering separate treats.  Celebrate accomplishment. Frequent rewards can help keep your family motivated. When your child meets a goal offer praise and attention instead of food rewards. When your family meets a goal, brainstorm healthy ways to celebrate your success. You might try a family movie night, a weekend picnic or a trip to a fun park.  Keep it positive. Focus on healthy lifestyle changes, rather than your child's appearance or a number on the scale. Remember, treating childhood obesity will take some time and dedication to replace bad habits with new, healthier behaviors.  Be Determined. It takes time to develop and maintain new healthy habits. Encourage everyone to not give up. Do your best as a parent to make it fun and educate on why its important to develop healthy habits now. Making lifestyle changes can be challenging, especially when you're busy juggling the demands of everyday life. If your family encourages and supports each other, then most likely you will beat the obesity cycle. Eventually healthy habits will become routine, and you'll be on your way to overcoming childhood obesity and improving your family's health. ]] Eating properly, the right amounts at the right time will optimize your workouts by giving you the energy and nutrients your body craves. Here are some tips on eating and exercise to assist you in maximizing your workout: 1. Eat Breakfast - If you exercise in the morning, get up early enough to eat breakfast, waiting 2-3 hours for a large meal or 1-2 for smaller meals. Most of the energy you got from dinner the previous night is used up by morning, and your blood sugar may be low. Eating a large amount before you exercise can leave you feeling sluggish, or worse, with a case of diarrhea or stomach cramps. Eating too little may not give you the energy to keep you feeling strong throughout your workout Here are some sample meals that provide protein to help build muscle:  Steal cut oatmeal with a few berries  4 egg whites or 1 whole egg with some chopped veggies.  1 whole wheat waffle with 1 tablespoon of natural almond or peanut butter  Protein, high fiber shake with berries or banana  8oz 2. Snack healthy  Most people can eat small snacks right before exercise but if eaten to soon before wont give you added energy but it will help keep up your blood sugar. Good snack options:  Apple with peanut butter or almond butter  Low glycemic protein bar  Protein and fiber shake  Handful of almonds 3. Eat after you exercise - To help your muscles recover and to replace their glycogen stores, eat a meal that contains both protein and carbohydrates within two hours of your exercise session if possible. If you aren't hungry after your workout, drink juice or a fruit smoothie to provide replenishing carbohydrates. Good post-workout food choices include: Almonds or walnuts, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, apple with peanut butter or string cheese, or regular meal consisting of lean meat, tofu and vegetables.  Drink plenty of water  Replenishing your fluids is necessary for optimizing your workout. You need water before, during and after exercise. To stay well hydrated the America College of Sports Medicine recommends: Drink roughly 2 to 3 cups of water during the two to three hours before your workout, 12 cup to 1 cup of water every 15-20 minutes during and 2-3 cups after your workout for every pound of weight you lose during the workout. Here is a quote from Coach Shannon Wallace: Train like an athlete no matter who you are. Some people think that athletes are someone that jumps high, runs fast, and can catch a ball. That is a reality-disconnect. We all have the same bio-mechanicswe all sit, walk and stand. We can all train like an athlete. So what are you waiting for? ]] Even if you work at a desk all day, you dont need to take it constantly sitting down. Make fitness a part of your work day. Here are some ways to incorporate exercise into your office routine: 1. Make the most of your commute - Walk or bike to work. If you drive park a few blocks away and walk the rest of the way or park at the far end of the parking lot. Also, take the stairs rather than the elevator, walk briskly or even run a few extra times up and down. 2. Look for opportunities to stand - You'll burn more calories standing than sitting. Stand while on the phone. Better yet, try a standing desk. Eat lunch standing up. Trade instant messaging and phone calls for walks to other desks or offices 3. Take Fitness Breaks  Take some time to go to a gym thats nearby if you can on your lunch break or go for a fast walk around the building. Eat a small protein snack such as almonds or almond butter on an apple before you work out, and then eat a veggie wrap or lean meat wrap with veggies after. 4. Try a fitness ball instead of an office chair - Consider trading your desk chair for a firmly inflated fitness or stability ball, as long as you're able to safely balance on the ball. You'll improve your balance and tone your core muscles while sitting at your desk. You can even use the fitness ball for wall squats, abdominal crunches or other workplace exercises during the day. 5. Keep fitness equipment in your office  Store resistance bands, weights, or if there is room in your office, an elliptical or treadmill. Use arm weights between meetings, while on the phone or any time you can sneak them in. 6. Organize a group to walk with  This will help keep you motivated and accountable. 7. Conduct meetings on the go - When it's practical, schedule walking meetings or walking brainstorming sessions. Do laps inside your building or, if the weather cooperates, take your walking meetings outdoors. 8. Try a treadmill desk - If you're ready to take workplace exercise to the next level, consider a treadmill with a computer screen on a stand, a keyboard on a table or a specialized treadmill-ready vertical desk. In fact, Mayo Clinic researchers estimate that overweight office workers who replace sitting computer time with walking computer time by two to three hours a day could lose 44 to 66 pounds in a year. The pace doesn't need to be brisk, nor do you need to break a sweat. The faster you walk, however, the more calories you'll burn. Now that you have some ideas on working in some exercise, make it happen! Commit to do some form of exercise each day and you will not only get in shape, and have more energy; you will find you are more productive. What are you waiting for? Get moving! ]] Not all metabolisms are created equal. Some people are blessed with faster metabolisms than some and seem to be able to eat anything without gaining weight. For others, their bodies seem to cling to a heavier weight no matter what they do. The speed at which your body burns calories is called metabolic rate. Your sex, height, weight, genetics, age, lifestyle, and body composition affect your metabolism. Your metabolism plays a significant role in weight management: The faster your metabolism, the more calories you'll burn, and the less likely that you'll be overweight. Here are a few dos and donts for revving up your metabolism:  There are several opinions about foods that can boost your metabolism but nothing proven. Some studies I have read say that spicy foods can increase your metabolism but only if eaten two to three times a week. There have also been rumors that grapefruit increases your body's ability to burn calories because of its acidity, but there are no studies to substantiate that myth.  Dont skip meals. Skipping meals can actually cause your metabolism to slow down. Denying the body of essential nutrients put your body in starvation mode and through off your metabolism. Eating 4-6 meals a day can speed up your metabolism, as long as they are healthy meals.  Drink water. Lack of water can slow the metabolic rate just as lack of food can, says John Acquaviva, PhD, assistant professor of health and human performance at Roanoke College in Salem, Va. "Since water is the body's most important nutrient, the liver will turn its concentration to water retention instead of doing other duties such as burning fat."  Tone Up. Muscle dictates metabolism so the more muscle you have the more calories you will burn  even while youre sleeping! Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, so replacing your fat stores with lean muscle allows you to maintain your weight much more easily.  Aerobic Activity can increase your metabolism. Most exercise experts say to do at least 6o minutes of moderate exercise a day such as walking, gardening, or cleaning. Although, if you want to burn more calories, its necessary to get your heart rate up. This also is important for your cardiovascular system to stay healthy.  Adjust your metabolism as you get older. To maintain a stable weight, adjust your caloric intake and physical activity. You may need fewer calories, especially if you decrease your exercise. In conclusion, eating 4-6 healthy meals a day, staying toned and exercising regularly can keep your metabolism revved up. Also, it will help you maintain a healthy weight; have more energy and live an all around healthier life! ]] Research has shown that most adults usually gain around 5-10 pounds over the holidays.

What an awesome way to start the New Year  feeling better and looking better! ]] In my last article, I listed several reasons why we dont value our health or for that matter our lives. My hope in this article is to cause you to think about how valuable you are. My number one frustration as a coach is that my clients dont take their health seriously until its too late and they have a major illness or disease. Here are some more reasons we dont invest time or money to take care of ourselves:  Lack of a support system. If you dont have others in your life that will support you, it is very difficult to develop a healthy lifestyle. Many times my clients sabotage themselves or allow others to sabotage them. They start off excited and ready to make a change and then someone plants a seed of doubt in them, and because they dont value themselves, they give up. When having the accountability and encouragement of a coach and good social network a person is twice as likely to succeed. This is why my groups are more successful than one on one coaching clients. Its very important to position others in your life that have a positive outlook and want to help you succeed.  Lack of commitment. One thing I always say before my client begins my TLS Weight Loss class is Are you ready and committed to making a change? If they hesitate, I encourage them to really think about how important their health is to them. Many want to be healthy but are not willing to make the necessary changes it takes to become healthier. If this is the case, I recommend they wait until they are ready.  Lack of willpower. Willpower can be a great thing if you have it but the problem comes when you begin to Reason. For example, Reason can talk you out of going for your morning jog when its cold and gloomy out. Your right, it says, its too yucky to jog. Im sure you have found that when you really dont want to do something, you can talk yourself out of it! Willpower and discipline are critically important for a successful life, but willpower alone is not usually enough to bring you across the finish line. Drawing your strength from God can help you do all things. Finally, valuing your life and investing in yourself is vital to become happy and healthy. My hope is that you will realize how valuable you are!]] Taking care of your health is not an indulgence, its respecting yourself, others and God. When you dont take care of your health, you can end up sick and debilitated while putting a burden on others who must take care of you. Throughout my coaching practice I have come to discover several reasons why people dont value themselves as they should. My passion as a coach is to educate and help people to grasp how valuable they are in hopes they will invest some time in their health so as to lead the life God has intended for them. Here are some reasons we dont invest time or money to take care of ourselves: 1. Lack of knowledge - Many people dont realize how foods impact their body. They have never had any education on nutrition. They rely on fast food and prepackaged meals that have no or very little nutritional value. Their lives are so hectic; they dont take time to eat sensibly. Once they can understand how easy and affordable it is to eat healthy many adjust their eating habits. 2. We have a distorted image of how we are to look  We have been inundated with media telling us how we should look, but on the other hand, obesity is so prevalent -its almost the norm! 3. We dont recognize the importance of exercise  Being too busy to exercise is one of the common excuses I hear from my clients. Exercise is essential to our overall well-being. Here are just a few of the benefits: stress reliever, improves moods, and boosts energy, plus many more! Exercise needs to be a priority in your life so that you can accomplish the things that are important. 4. We dont enjoy our lives  I am dismayed by a number of my clients that fall into this category. They are so busy; they cut everything they enjoy out of their lives. God never intended our lives to be mundane and stressful. Once you can learn the impact stress has on your physical and emotional well being, you can begin to understand what a crime against yourself this is. Life is too short not to be enjoyed! 5. Some have become addicted to selflessness  Yes, its important to help others and it should be a major part of your life, but not to the extent of ignoring your basic needs. For some, the only thing that gives them meaning is doing for others. Everything in life must have a balance or something breaks down and often its us. There are several other reasons why we dont take care of ourselves so make sure you read my next article. Above all, value your life  its the greatest gift you will ever receive! ]] Energy supplements have become one of the most popular categories of supplements. It seems like everyone these days needs an energy boost. Hectic lifestyles seem to be one of the main reasons for lack of energy and a desire for something that can help. But do they work? Some energy supplements may help but you need to know what you are looking for. Otherwise, supplements you buy could just leave you hundreds of dollars poorer and no less sluggish. Here is some information that may help guide you to the supplements that can benefit you the most. Its also important to get advice from a physician who has been educated on supplementation: To help break it down, I will divide these energy supplement ingredients into three categories: 1. Stimulants  Can help rev up the metabolism. Here are lists of energy supplements which contain these:  Caffeine - is a common ingredient in just about any product marketed for energy, while an energy drink might have 20 other ingredients, the one you really feel is likely to be caffeine. Caffeine can step up your metabolism and can even give you greater mental clarity. Although, most experts say to have no more than 2 cups a day.  Herbal sources of caffeine and related compounds like guarana, yerba mate, and kola nut  Green tea (also a source of caffeine) - also provides a related compound, theophylline, as well as the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Possibly, because of these specific compounds, green tea may have unique effects on mental and physical energy.  Capsaicin (red pepper) - the ingredient that makes chili peppers hot; is sometimes used for its alleged stimulant properties, but more for a metabolic boost than for improvements in physical or mental energy.  Asian Ginseng - is not a caffeine derivative, but it may also serve as a mild stimulant. There is some scientific research that shows it can have positive effects on psychological and physical health.  Bitter Orange (specifically, the ingredient synephrine)  is an extract from the rind of a different citrus species than that used for classic orange juice, is another energy supplement unrelated to caffeine. Though it has not been studied much, some experts fear there could be some risks taking it. Its active ingredient- synephrine is chemically similar to ephedrine which was pulled off the market in 2004 because of some serious health risks. For lack of space, I will need to continue the other categories next week. The bottom line: Will these supplements boost energy? Yes, stimulants like these most likely will rev up your metabolism temporarily, but the key is eating healthy, exercising as well as taking a superior line of supplements. ]] Last week I gave some information on supplements that may help you get an energy boost. With todays hurried lifestyles we need all the energy we can get! Here are some other substances that may affect energy metabolism:  Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) - is the vital nutrient that initiates energy production at the cellular level that powers the heart and acts as a powerful antioxidant when combined with vitamin E. It plays a vital role in health maintenance. It contributes to a healthy cardiovascular system, periodontal health, healthy blood sugar levels, and maintenance of cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations.  B vitamins, like vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folic acid, thiamine, niacian- these are necessary to take because they are water soluble and our bodies do not produce them. They help decrease stress and improve mood, and maintain healthy levels of serotonin.  Creatine, carnitine - might actually decrease athletic performance in longer-term physical activity and carries some risk. Some experts say it can interfere with sweating, thus contributing to dehydration, muscle strain, and cramps. Deficiencies in these vitamins are common. People who are deficient in CoQ10 and B vitamins can definitely benefit from taking supplements. Who is likely to be deficient? Athletes who push themselves hard might be depleted in these nutrients. Also, people who have poor diets or take regular medications, such as acid blockers, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, blood pressure, cholesterol lowering medication and several more can become deficient. Also, we can no longer get all the vitamins in our foods any longer since our soil is depleted, and pesticides and chemicals have been added to our fruits, vegetables and meats. Not to mention the poor diet most Americans have. Some other energy supplements that are popular with my clients are Mochatonix which contains an ingredient  Advantra Z. When combined with exercise, can help to the body burn fat, build lean muscle mass, and increase physical performance. Not only does it provide additional energy, it can help the body use more efficiently the energy stored in fat. In conclusion, there is a lot to learn about supplementation and how it can truly help you feel more energetic and stay healthy.]] Its that time of year again when many of us makes a resolution to lose weight and live healthier- but why dont these resolutions last? In this article I will give you a few reasons why resolutions to lose weight dont work. 1. Diets dont work . Diets are a temporary way of life. On the quest to lose weight many people try quick fix diets such as, shakes, low calorie foods, fad diets, health clubs and other weight loss attempts. Being overweight is like wearing a bulls eye  you are a target for companies trying to make money from your condition. Restrictive diets do not work; you must make a lifestyle change. "Lifestyle change will work if you have realistic expectations, good support, and choose a plan that you can stick with -- a plan that will give you moderate change over a long time Fernstrom tells WebMD. 2. Behaviors do not change automatically . Instead of riding the diet roller coaster up and down, you need to make a constant effort to change. If you dont change your lifestyle behaviors, dont expect to achieve or maintain a healthy weight. That is why most diet plans dont work; you are not taught how to eat for a lifetime, change your behavior or incorporate exercise. 3. Diet is affected by social issues . This happens when you are with your family and friends. In the American setting, unhealthy eating and dietary patterns is often encouraged. This makes it very difficult to keep healthy lifestyle changes going. Dont allow others to discourage you and cause you to give up; keep your focus to accomplish what you set out to, no matter the cost. 4. Lack of accountability . Many people try to reach their weight loss goals on their own. Usually, they quickly give up because no one is there to inspire or encourage them to press past the challenges. Having a coach is crucial for success. Just as a good coach helps their team win the game with education, encouragement and inspiration, so a Lifestyle Coach can help you achieve your goals of weight-loss and a healthy lifestyle Its time for a different approach. Its time to find the answer thats right for you. That answer is making a lifestyle change that will last, not a temporary solution that will fail. Start with a positive attitude and determination to stop the diet roller coaster!]] Are You at Risk for Sitting Disease? How much do you sit throughout the day? Medical experts have started referring to long periods of inactivity and its negative consequences as Sitting Disease. People can spend up to half of their day sitting, whether it is at their work station or on their couch. New studies are saying what has been suspected for a while; if youre sitting for long periods of time, you may be at risk for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. In fact, in a study presented at the American Institute for Cancer Researchs annual conference, there have been 90,000 cancer deaths that can be attributed to the fact that people are exercising less than ever. Breast cancer has also been linked to inactivity. Consequently, when youre seated your muscles electrical activity drops, which incites a flow of unwanted metabolic effects. The bodys calorie-burning mechanisms slow and insulin efficiency drops, escalating the risk of diabetes. Obesity becomes a concern because enzymes that break down lipids and triglycerides also drop, bringing levels of good (HDL) cholesterol down with them (Dr. Neil Baums blog). Whats more, even regular exercise doesnt seem to outweigh the ills of sitting through the workday. Here are some tips to help you revamp your lifestyle to become more physically active:  (NEAT) Nonexercise Activity Thermogenesis. If you sit at a desk all day, you may consider stretching, bending and turning several times throughout the day. Also, try mixing standing and sitting.  Take regular breaks. Most people know lack of exercising will cause weight gain, but this doesnt usually motivate them to become more active. It helps to get moving often with small goals. Stretch out your entire body, all the muscles that are cramped. If you do it five or six times a day, you'll start to notice a difference."  Exercise while watching television. Its time to bring the treadmill, bike or elliptical out of the basement and put it in front of your TV. This is how a client told me they lost weight. They made the commitment to get on their treadmill every time they watched TV for at least an hour.  End your workday with more energy. Prolonged sitting at work can tire you out, which makes you fill exhausted by the time 5 p.m. approaches. If you take a brisk, 15-minute walk in the afternoon, you'll be far more productive in your last two hours. Making time to get a little exercise in will give you more energy all day long. Lastly, whatever you can do to move more do it! Walk, stretch, stand, ride a bike or get on an elliptical. Not only will you feel more energetic, improve your moods and decrease your chance for several diseases, you will also prolong your life span and quality of life! So what are you waiting for? ]] There are many people who desperately want to lead a healthier lifestyle but are not sure how to get started or are afraid to try because they have failed before. They have tried several different diets, or they keep trying to do the same one, only to end up with the same results and are now even more discouraged. This is usually when they give up and figure their lot in life is to be overweight, and unhealthy. So what is holding them back from seeking help and moving forward? Here are some of the reasons or excuses I have heard from people:  I dont think I can do it  Its too hard  I cant afford it  I dont feel like it  I dont have the time We often do things based on feelings. If we dont feel like it, we dont do it, even when we know its healthier. If we can learn to focus on the consequences verses rewards of not doing something or doing something, then we are more apt to follow through. For example, I dont always feel like exercising, but I know its good for me and I will feel much better afterwards. This motivates me to exercise again, and I now love to do it! Many times we defeat ourselves before we even get started. Weve already convinced ourselves we cant do it so we dont even try. Set your mind to determine decisively what you will think, what you believe and what you will or will not do. Establish that you will become healthier no matter what it takes and dont give up! I have seen many of my clients succeed when they at first lacked the confidence to even try. Once they started they got more and more confidence, while getting encouragement and support from the group and coach, which lead to their success. This wouldnt have happened if they wouldnt have taken that step of faith and overcome that loser mentality. If you seriously want to improve your lifestyle, you may consider joining my group competition  TLS Lose to Win. I am looking for four people to coach who need to lose weight and make a change. The group will be entered in a national competition and can win large cash prizes. Contact me by February 25th if you are interested. In conclusion, as one of my clients so adequately put it: Champions make decisions to birth a better future; losers make excuses to stay the same as today. I believe God has placed champions in each of us; its up to us to start living it out! ]] Preventing the Cycle of Childhood Obesity In my previous article I gave some daunting statistics on childhood obesity, one of them being that over nine million children over the age of nine are considered extremely overweight or obese. Many times I hear my clients tell me that its impossible to get their children to eat healthy. In our day and age children are inundated with poor food choices not only in school, fast food restaurants or a friends house but also because of what we as parents provide. We have a choice and a responsibility to be the parent and provide healthy food for our children, but it can be a challenge. That is why I decided to share how one of my clients has overcome the cycle of obesity by being strong enough to change poor eating habits that have caused herself and her children to become overweight. Here is Margarets story: When you have a child, you are entrusted to be their protector and their provider. Three square meals a day and a warm bed to sleep in are two basics and the list grows from there. The problem is that three square meals a day is a title that does not come with a manual. Is that Macaroni and cheese from a box? Is that Ravioli from a can? Is that a bologna sandwich loaded with catsup and pickles? As mothers we depend on that happy satisfied smile on our little ones face to tell us that they are satisfied with what they have consumed. Three pieces of pizza and a soda pop has never been good for the body but it will bring a smile out of a child in a quick minute. And when we believe they are content then we are content. My family and I were facing this. They only ate what I fed them. I was totally responsible for their diet so the extra weight that they were carrying around was my issue and not so much theirs. It was quickly becoming theirs, however. When I started Transitions Lifestyle I realized that their diet was all wrong. They should be eating five times a day, not three and they should never eat canned or prepackaged meals. Changing what I provided for them and then packing their lunches for school were necessary. I cannot say that they did not oppose the change. They wanted the candy bars and lunchables back in the house, but I stood my ground and before you know it, in a matter of a few weeks, the extra weight that they were starting to show, was coming off. Next week I will continue Margarets story because I believe it can help parents who struggle with convincing their children to eat healthy. Dont get discouraged, and be persistent  you can win the battle! ]] The next time you begin craving sweets or want to down half a pizza, go take a hike or a jog. Exercise, especially cardio exercise can help decrease your cravings. Here are five ways exercise can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle: 1. In a recent study that was published by Appetite, people who took a brisk fifteen minute walk, cut their cravings for chocolate by 12%. Not only does it cut cravings for sweets, but it also can cause you to crave healthier foods. Why ruin a great workout by eating junk food! 2. Lose the belly fat. A study in the journal Obesity found that just 80 minutes of cardio a week slows weight gain and even stopped participants from gaining visceral fat which is the dangerous kind inside the abdomen, and has been linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 3. Exercise can diffuse nicotine cravings. Research shows that 10-15 minute aerobic sessions triggers changes in the brain which decreases cravings in smokers. Cardio exercise has also been found to decrease thoughts of smoking. 4. Vigorous activity can help maintain healthy vision. It has also been discovered that people who ran 1.2  2.5 miles a day had a 19 percent lower risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, while those who ran more cut their chance by 42 to 54 percent, according to a study from Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science . Cardio exercise may also decrease cataract risk . 5. Exercise can decrease the risk of breast cancer. In study done by Medicine Science Sports Exercise it has been found that women who do moderate exercise for 2.5 hours a week or rigorous activity for 75 minutes a week decrease their chance of dying of breast cancer by a third. Aerobic exercise and sweat also helps your body release toxins that are stored in fat. When toxins are built up in our body, we experience various health issues. Many people, who only do mild to moderate exercise, are not getting the benefits of a vigorous workout. In conclusion, cardio exercise is important to maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Not only will you feel better and have more energy, you will also decrease your risk of several diseases, obesity and other health issues. So put on your sneakers and take a vigorous walk or run today. Think of all the benefits of exercise; enjoy your heart pumping, your legs moving and your body sweating! You may not feel good at first but you will be thankful you did! ]] Many people that are successful in all areas of life are people who know how to manage their time. Not only are they organized, they accomplish what they set out to do. Do you ever look at highly successful people and wander how they do all that they do and still manage to exercise and eat healthy? Here are some tips that may help you manage your time while including a health regimen: 1. Daily track your time. If youve ever tried to lose weight, a nutritionist may tell you to keep a food journal because it keeps you from eating mindlessly. Its the same with time. Write down what youre doing as often as you can so you know what to eliminate and how you can spend it more productively. A lot of our time is spent unproductively for example; at night you may spend time watching TV. Instead of just sitting there, use this time to get on your elliptical while your favorite show is on or record it later so you can watch while you exercise in the morning. 2. It all starts in the morning. What you do in the morning usually determines what the rest of your day looks like. When you have an unproductive morning, this seems to dictate the rest of your day. Start your day with some personal growth such as, reading a daily devotional or inspirational message. Praying for your day can keep you on track, and helps you set your priorities. Map out your day by writing in your day planner. 3. Build your habits. Turning a desire into a ritual requires willpower. Use these steps to optimize your routine:  Start at a slow pace  Go to bed 15 minutes early so you can get your exercise regimen in. Then the next week increase it to 20 minutes earlier.  Monitor your energy  Eating right and exercising daily will give you the energy you need to have a productive day.  Choose one habit at a time to work on  If you want to run, pray and begin to eat healthier, pick one at a time until you have it accomplished and then begin the other.  Chart your progress  This will help you see how you are doing and what you need to change to form your habit. When you feel as if youve forgotten something such as brushing your teeth, then you know you have formed a habit.  Use external motivations  Promise yourself something you really enjoy once youve successfully formed a habit. In conclusion, if you will learn how to manage your time, and set priorities you are on your way to a healthier and more productive life! ]] Many people that have children who have been diagnosed with ADHD or that have it themselves have wandered if vitamins and supplements can help with ADHD as an alternative to medication. This has been a question I seem to get asked often so I thought I would share what Ive learned about supplementation and ADHD with my training and research. Since I am not a health professional, I recommend you seek help with one that is open to alternative medicine. What is ADHD? Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) seems to be a common developmental and behavioral disorder characterized by lack of concentration, distractibility, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness that are inappropriate for the childs age. Over the past few decades, alternative or complementary medicine has grown in popularity. More and more people are looking for nontraditional approaches to personal health and healing. These diverse remedies are sometimes used in the place of typical medical approaches. Several alternative remedies are safe, relatively affordable, and easily accessible. They also very rarely have the harmful side effects. It is important to get educated on what works and what doesnt even if it is a natural supplement, there is no guarantee its safe. Here are a few supplements that have been researched and have shown to be beneficial with ADHD as well as ADD:  Zinc  Some studies have shown that children with ADHD have lower levels of Zinc in their body. And some scientists have reported improved symptoms in children with ADHD who took zinc supplements along with traditional medicine.  Omega 3 - There is some evidence that fish oil can help improve ADHD symptoms. Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids. Some studies suggest, in children with ADHD who are 8 to 12 years old, fish oil supplementation could improve mental skills. For instance, it may help improve a child's ability to organize activities. In a study published in a 2007 issue of the "Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics," researchers studied the affect of fish oil and evening primrose oil on children aged between 7 to 12 years with ADHD. In the background to their study they explain that various developmental problems including ADHD have been linked to deficiencies in polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Carnitine  Is an amino acid which is important for energy production. The University of Michigan recommends taking 100mg of carnitine for each 2.2 pounds of body weight, up to a maximum of 4g daily, to help improve behavior.  Magnesium  According to the University of Michigan children with ADHD may have low levels of magnesium. A 1997 study published in "Magnesium Research" found that 200mg of magnesium daily for six months reduced hyperactive behavior in children with ADHD . Finally, diet also plays a big part in reducing symptoms of ADHD . Children who have healthy diets; plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and organic meats, can also improve symptoms. ]] Note: This is an article from a fellow blogger- John O'Connor It used to be that many people assumed that little could be done to prevent hearing loss.  They believed that hearing loss was inevitable as they grew older and that their everyday lifestyles contributed nothing toward losing the ability to hear.  However, doctors today argue that a person's lifestyle directly influences how well that person can hear as he or she grows older.  Certain habits can be discarded or altered if people want to protect their sense of hearing. In fact, loud noises continue to be the greatest risk to one's hearing .  People who work in noisy conditions or listen to loud music compromise their ability to hear well.  Frequent exposure to loud noises damages a person's eardrums and sometimes causes it to rupture.  For that reason, doctors urge people to limit their exposure to such noises or wear ear plugs if they work in noisy environments. Likewise, people can take preventative measures to protect their hearing by eating a healthy diet.  Diabetes has been identified as one of the conditions that contribute to hearing loss.  In fact, many diabetics report that they no longer hear as well as they did before they developed this condition.  While many people are not aware of the link between diet and hearing loss, doctors note that people who eat healthy, get plenty of exercise, and avoid gaining too much weight overtime often hear better and keep their sense of hearing longer. Moreover, people who smoke also put themselves at risk for losing their ability to hear well as they grow older.  More than 70% of smokers report hearing loss, leading doctors to believe that smoking has a direct effect on people's inability to hear.  Even individuals who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke indicate a compromised hearing ability.  For that reason, physicians also encourage people to quit smoking if they value their sense of hearing. Aside from watching one's diet, exercising, and avoiding cigarette use, many doctors recommend that people clean out their ears regularly.  This suggestion would appear to be common sense; however, some people do not think to remove excess wax from their ear canals and when doing so, remove wax in a harmful way.   Even so, periodically washing one's ears out with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide helps remove wax build up in the ear canals.  To ensure safety, visit your doctor to have wax properly removed from your ear canals. If you feel you are beginning to lose your hearing, a trip to the audiologist could be very helpful.  An audiologist will be able to run certain tests to determine base line hearing levels.  With these results, they will be able to provide tips on how to further protect your hearing or in some cases recommend the use of a hearing aid to help better hearing.  Following the tips mentioned above and making healthy lifestyle changes not only will improve your health but also protect your hearing. ]] Accountability is important factor in being successful with your weight-loss goals. Many people try to lose weight on their own only to find themselves back where they started. We need that voice of reason, stability, and rationality encouraging us to persevere and not give up. That is why having a friend or a coach is a vital component in helping you reach your goals. A friend can usher you to a place of break through when you want to give in to that chocolate cake or bag of chips. When that inevitable time comes, it can be hard to stay focused and get back on track. Accountability partners encourage you to move forward when quitting would be the easiest route. Here are some ways to stay accountable:  Set up a healthy eating plan. Ask your accountability partner to check with you every day to see if you are sticking with it and to not allow you to cheat. If you need education on nutrition and what you should be eating, hire an expert to help you  Journal. Record your meals, snacks as well as, feelings that trigger your unhealthy eating. A coach can bring authority and expertise where as a friend may only offer suggestions.  Create a Timeline. When setting up accountability for yourself, establishing a realistic but aggressive timeline will help you succeed. For example, "I want to lose 10 pounds" is not as effective as "I want to lose 10 pounds by my birthday." For large goals, benchmarks are an important part of the timeline. Instead of deciding to lose 48 lbs. in a year, commit to losing 4 lbs. per month for 12 months. This keeps you on track for success instead of pushing hard in the last weeks of your timeline.  Rewards. Building rewards into your weight-loss accountability may help keep you on track also.  Give yourself some kind of recognition as you reach different benchmarks. For some, this may mean a new outfit in the size you are striving to reach, or a spa day. I recommend for weight-loss goals, not to have food-based rewards. This sets you up for defeat. After you begin seeing results, momentum will build and you may not need to have an accountability partner although, it doesn't hurt to have someone asking you every now and then how youre doing.  If you could use accountability, support and education, consider joining my Transitions Lifestyle class.
