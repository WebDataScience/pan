 I really need to note this in a few sentences. If you ever encounter the problem, that you cannot establish a VPN/PPTP connection using A1 UMTS; Call them, tell them they are stupid and should deactivate the firewall. Oh yes. You read correctly. They now have a firewall, that actually blocks the GRE protocol (outgoing). Is this stupid? Yes. Very stupid! Perfect service A1! Makes more problems than it helps! ]] Yes, AlphaCore has me again. I reinstalled my DS10, after MikeBarnes sent me some memory. Memory is bad, so I had to buy some more on ebay. However, finally I got the machine up'n'running and now I'm reporting bugs, patching for alpha, waiting for gcc, binutils, glibc and so on to produce good rpms. You may know, gcc takes very long to compile on a reasonable fast (x86-based) machine... It takes much longer on our good ol' Alphas. read more ]] And Fedora also has me again. I'm now officially an Ambassador for Austria: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ OliverFalk . Why? Just for fun, just because I like Fedora and just because of AlphaCore , which is based on Fedora. ]] Nothing more to say: http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/price-compare/]] It's some time ago since my last post. Bad /me. I'm really working hard on the new buildsystem for AlphaCore . Or better said for Fedora 8 Alpha. Since Koji (the new Fedora BuildSystem ) doesn't come with a good documentation, it was quite hard to setup and understand. However, I manged it and it's now available here: http://buildsys.zero42.at/koji/. It will stay there for now. Some more docs on how to set it up: http://wiki.linux-kernel.at/index.php/Koji. I should really put this on Fedora Wiki ]] Well, posting my blog, that's true. I'm really lazy, but there are so many things going on at the moment; I'd really like to tell, but it's all confidential. Well. We ( AlphaCore team) have lost Christian Balint and Red Hat lost him as well. He was offered with a good job opportunity and took it. Since this job will make him traveling a lot and also will require him to work hard, he will not have time to do much of our AlphaCore thingy. read more ]] I'm trying to fix the notify... Currently the links are broken. Sorry!]] We - especially I - do think about giving away redhat.at. Not to *someone*, but to Red Hat (http://redhat.com)! I really like the domain. I know some of you do also... I'd be happy to receive comments if someone has to say anything Keep watching http://redhat.at and be informed that this site will not die! It will stay online as http://linux-kernel.at and http://open-source.at (at least). ]]
