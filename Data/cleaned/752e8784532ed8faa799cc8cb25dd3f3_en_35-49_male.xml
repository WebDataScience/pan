Scott's research study showed that when assessing pelvic varicose veins in women, the trans-vaginal ultrasound scan is the Gold Standard test.

However we have just published a fascinating case of an extremely rare complication. ?? Arterial false aneurysm in the groin following endovenous laser ablation Ostler AE, Holdstock JM, Harrison CC, Whiteley MS. Following EVLA treatment, our patient developed a tense "pseudoanerysm" in the groin - bleeding from a local artery. At The Whiteley Clinic we have an emergency telephone system and so the patient was able to come straight back again. Our specialist vascular technologists were able to identify the precise cause of the problem and the patient was cured by injection of a drug to help clotting and precise pressure on the bleeding vessel by the duplex ultrasound probe.

Prof Mark Whiteley speaking at the Veith Symposium, in New York, Nov 2013 Photo - Courtesy: Vascular News ? Research from The Whiteley Clinic has made it clear that just treating the varicose veins in the legs is not enough for optimal treatment in many patients. Our research has shown that leg varicose veins are not only associated with the usual long veins that run up the leg, but also come from Incompetent Perforating Veins and Pelvic Veins in many patients. This suggests that patients who only have the leg veins investigated and treated are much more likely to get their varicose veins back again after treatment - varicose vein recurrence. Most doctors in the world still only provide simple investigation and treatment of the main leg veins, and do not look for, or treat, incompetent perforating veins nor pelvic veins. At The Whitely Clinic we use The Whiteley Protocol - making sure that everyone gets a full investigation and all of their vein problems are treated. This is why our patient satisfaction is so high and our audited results show such a low rate of recurrence after our treatments. Prof Mark Whiteley was asked to present his research and views at the Veith Symposium in New York in the form of 2 debates and one lecture: DEBATE: Pre-emptive Strike on Perforators Reduces Recurrences Mark S Whiteley Detecting Iliac, IVC, Ovarian Vessels by Duplex Mark S Whiteley DEBATE: Pre-emptive Strike on Incompetent Ovarian Veins Reduces Recurrences Mark S Whiteley The Whiteley Clinic - Specialists in varicose veins, leg ulcers, and venous disease. ]] Come and meet Prof Mark Whiteley, Mr Mike Rocker and members of The Whiteley Clinic Bristol varicose veins team on 16th December 2013.

Leg Ulcer Charity website launched - www.LegUlcerCharity.org Research over the last decade has shown that most leg ulcers can be cured by proper investigations and local anaesthetic endovenous surgery. Unfortunately, most patients only get offered bandages and dressings which might temporarily improve or heal the leg ulcer .... but as they do not affect the underlying causes, do not cure the problem in the long term. Hence the ulcer returns. Using proper modern medical investigations, specialists can find the underlying cause of the leg ulcer in the majority of patients and permanently fix it - curing the leg ulcer for good. The Leg Ulcer Charity has been set up to: EMPOWER patients, family and carers to ask for the right investigations and treatments to get a cure of a leg ulcer RESEARCH new leg ulcer investigations, treatments and effects that having a leg ulcer has on patients, family and society EDUCATE doctors and nurses to now about new methods to cure leg ulcers permanently Provide GRANTS to patients needing help to get their leg ulcer investigated and treated ?? ?

This revolutionary walk-in, walk-out surgical technique that reduces the number of injections needed for local anaesthetic and also reduces the need for compression stockings afterwards, has now been shown to have excellent results 1 year after treatment. Venaseal "superglue" is as effective as EVLA (endovenous laser ablation) and RFA (radiofrequency ablation) after 12 months - but does not need local anaesthetic to be infected along the course of the vein being treated - a process called "tumescence". This means far fewer injections - which is great news for anyone who doesn't like needles! ? However, being approximately 1,000 more than an EVLT (endovenous laser treatment) or RFA (radiofrequency ablation) treatment, not everyone will think that the reduced number of injections of local anaesthetic nor the possible reduction of days wearing compression stockings will be worth the extra cost. This study has shown that the technique is a real alternative to thermoablation of the veins using laser or radiofrequency, and particularly for those people with few visible bulging varicose veins and a dislike of needles and injections, Venaseal "superglue" provides a real alternative way to get varicose veins treated effectively and with minimal discomfort.
