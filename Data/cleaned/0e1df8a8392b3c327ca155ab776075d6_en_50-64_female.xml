 In advertising, it's the transition from managing the client to managing the business. In construction, it's the transition from managing the project to managing the business. In professional services firms it's the transition from delivering client services to advancing the business by revenue generation. In your company, it is likely the transition from managing managers to running a business. In every company there is a barrier that has been difficult for women to cross and it's usually the barrier between middle and senior/executive management. Why is it so difficult? Because, as Marshal Goldsmith writes, what got you here, won't get you there. For much of the past 40 years, advice to women has centered on important advice for getting from career-start to being successful in the middle. Advice such as: Get a mentor. Speak up! Do a better job at self-promotion. Engage your team. Hone your interpersonal skills. Network! And all of this good advice builds skills that are taken with successful women who transition from middle management to senior/executive positions. For example, Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell's has had mentors at every stage in her career and Anne Mulcahy used her prodigious people skills with external customers and staff to turn around Xerox. But if they had rested on this skill set, they would undoubtedly still be mired in the middle. Recently the Financial Times offered up career advice for women who want to get ahead: "Some companies offer help. Accenture, for example, has a Skills Academy and a course, called Move Beyond the Boys Club (Shameless Self-Promotion), that says career progression, especially in male-dominated fields, is a blend of aptitude and attitude, manoeuvrability, understanding office politics, allied to self-awareness and confidence. It says: 'Women who get ahead are those who make key decision-makers aware of their wins. When you work with men, you have to learn to play the game and get comfortable raising your profile the way they do  we should take the best of what they can teach us while maintaining a sense of our own integrity, individuality and independence.'" Yes, self-promotion, aptitude and all the rest is important, but here's what executives tell us they require before they'll risk social capital to sponsor someone - a track record of business success. One recently said, "I won't waste my social capital sponsoring a woman who I don't see as a businesswoman." So all of the traditional advice is good to get women to the middle, but it's not great to get women to the top. Instead, companies and advisors have to cultivate a new set of advice for ambitious women in the middle. Advice such as: Hone your financial acumen. Learn the business of your business. Take key operational assignments. Enhance your ability to understand/set strategy and the role finances play. Take global assignments. Take assignments that put you close to strategy setting. Cultivate an influential external strategic network. When I asked a panel of executives what they look for in high potential candidates, the bottom line is that the cluster of business, strategic and financial competencies are the door opener - interpersonal/team skills and individual qualities are the differentiators. Too few women get this message - maybe 2-3 out of a room of 100. It's why so many are mired in the middle. It's beyond time to change this! If you and your organiztion are ready to change the advice given to women...

What corporate women need to know about strategic relationships and success Follow on Twitter | LittlePinkBook | Facebook | LinkedInGroup | LinkedIn ]] Conventional advice to women has little to say about executive communication, board communication and media skills. It's one reason why conventional advice to women won't close the gender gap at the top and why Leading Women focuses on these skills in our Leadership Mastery and Breakthrough Leadership programs. So, it's refreshing to come across a high-value news release from Anne D. Grant on executive communication. In the excerpt below, notice that among the skills being tested were use of numbers , positive monetary impact and development of products/process (i.e. Outcomes ). Her findings are aligned with what we teach about Using the Language of PowerTM and the Power of Language and with how to Self-Promote with Grace and AuthenticityTM. "With painstaking attention to every pause, 'eh,' and 'ah,' my team researched exactly how men and women answer the question: What are the accomplishments you are most proud of? Specifically, we analyzed video interviews of 20 men and 20 women in leadership roles at Fortune 50 companies in response to the question 'In your career, what are the accomplishments you are most proud of?' We chose this question because inevitably when leaders interview for promotions, they will confront this question. While not identical, the men and women were comparable in title as well as the representation of type of industry. We transcribed the 40 responses from the interviews. In terms of content dimensionality, we identified five categories of accomplishment: use of numbers, positive monetary impact, mentoring, development of products or processes, and position or longevity. We also used the transcriptions to analyze first-person pronoun usage, gestures, facial expressions, fillers, and response length. "What did we discover? Executive women undermined their achievements by: talking more and saying less demonstrating lack of confidence by beginning their answers with "ahs," "ehs," and fillers failing to speak analytically about their achievements when speaking in the personal voice  and cluttering their communication with gestures "The only category where executive women outshone men was in likeability  as demonstrated by smiling more and having more facial expressions.'" An absence of skill-building programs in these areas is one way that typical talent development resources have hidden gender bias.

Nearly 24% was advice about "...engaging the greatness in others." Only about 2% was advice about how to "...achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes." We often talk about Merrill Sherman, former CEO of Bank RI who told us that the best advice she ever received was to "be for the business" and also share other advice that we heard including: No matter what position you hold, act as if you own the business. Learn to understand the financials and the story they tell. Learn the business of your business. We continue to ask women to tell us their best career advice. Here are some others that you can add to your own collection and share with your proteges: Put together a solid business case to gain buy-in and support for any idea. Think about the big picture. Examine situations in the context of the impact on business. Learn what those in charge are concerned about. The other trend we see in the advice women receive and value is that it is predominantly focused on what we have to do to move from career-start into middle management and succeed there. It is advice that creates a platform for moving up, but isn't what will "get you there." The transition from middle management to executive levels requires business, strategic and financial acumen - an understanding of how to manage the business, not just manage the people. If you want to continue to create a career that soars, take hold of the advice shared here...and pass it on. Lead ON!

What corporate women need to know about strategic relationships ]] Here's a fact about closing the leadership gender gap that might surprise you. Back in the 1970s, progressive companies addressed the challenge of women's advancement issues with many tools including multi-day workshops that directly surfaced and addressed gender-based stereotypes. This is surprising because since then, companies have tended to avoid this topic like the plague. This in spite of the fact that studies continue to point to barriers created by gender-based expectations and assumptions. For example, McKinsey the global consulting firm has reported that: Of all the forces that hold women back, however, none are as powerful as entrenched beliefs. While companies have worked hard to eliminate overt discrimination, women still face the pernicious force of mindsets that limit opportunity ... For example Managers  male and female  continue to take viable female candidates out of the running, often on the assumption that the woman cant handle certain jobs and also discharge family obligations. And the recent HBR article on second-generation bias, "Second generation bias is embedded in stereotypes and organizational practices that can be hard to detect...hidden costs of this practice includes  high turnover, difficulty attracting women to the company, and a lack of diversity to match that of customers..." In anticipation of the day when companies once again are ready to take action on the fact that mindsets drive talent development decisions and actions, we've been tracking over 15 gender-based mindsets, how they influence the actions of people managers and actions managers can take to counter their "pernicious force". A small number of our clients in the U.S. have created opportunities to explore these gender dynamics. When the issue of quotas for board positions was all over the European press, we predicted that the appetite for tackling this dynamic would grow in Europe. Many countries have framed the issue of women's advancement more broadly as an issue of gender equality. What excites us about this is that we've always held that the absence of women at the top is a result of 3 factors: Women's skills, knowledge and attitudes about themselves and men. Men's skills, knowledge and attitudes about themselves and women. Formal and informal policies and practices of organizations and society. For 40 decades, organizations have resolutely addressed #1 and #3. This has resulted in moving many women into middle managment. But without an exploration of #2, progress in taking women to the top will continue to be glacially slow and as uneven as a potholed city street. What is your organization doing to help people managers (women and men) examine the impact of their gender-related mindsets? If you're ready to tackle gender dynamics, let us know. We have the tools to support your initiative.

What corporate women need to know about strategic relationships ]] Not long ago I came across a very active discussion on ForbesWoman with this "burning question:" "What are the top 10 things you think all women need to learn to master to succeed in life and work?" Here's what I observed about the replies. As you might expect the VAST majority of the answers had to do with enhancing personal greatness . Solid gold advice such as: believe that you're capable, take control of your life, discover your purpose, learn constantly, appreciate life, know your priorities and master emotions. The second most common answers had to do with engaging others . These were significantly fewer of these comments which included: network strategically, delegation, ask for help, and teamwork. There was virtually no guidance on the importance of developing and demonstrating business, strategic and financial acumen - out of 63 commentaries - many with multiple answers, there were about 3. I am disheartened by this because remember the question was what do women need to master to succeed in life AND WORK . Shanti Feldhahn points out in her book, The Male Factor , that women and men view the world differently - and this discussion illustrates her point. Women view the "work world" as a smaller circle within a larger "personal world" circle. The assumption derived from this view is that if we constantly work on enhancing our personal greatness we will inevitably succeed at work. Men view the "work world" and the "personal world" as separate circles, each with its own set of rules. And while to me this is a less appealing construction, to ignore it in our search for career succes is perilous. While it is true that honing our personal greatness will lead to success in life, it is simply not true that enhancing our personal greatness will naturally lead to success in work. As you know by now, success at work requires the development and demonstration of business, strategic and financial acumen. But that's not what I added to the discussion. My contribution to the discussion was that among the top 10 things all women need to master to succeed in life and work is this: To understand the difference between personal , professional and leadership excellence and act to develop all three. Here's what I meant and why this advice is so powerful. Imagine 3 concentric circles. At the center is personal excellence . Personal excellence is the core of what we need to navigate career and life successfully. All the advice about personal greatness is important here and working on this is fundamental. I know a woman who has twice run away from tough feedback. While she will continue to achieve a certain level of success...it's obvious that she is limited because she hasn't embraced the feedback. The second circle surrounding personal excellence is professional excellence . Professional excellence involves mastering one or more domains of action for example engineering, human resources, scientific research and/or parenting. This entails acquiring the body of knowledge, staying current and honing related skills such as your interpersonal skills. As I'm writing I'm thinking of Lynn Elsenhans, CEO of Sunoco who took increasingly responsible positions in industry organizations as she progressed in her career. The third circle is leadership excellence ...and, as you know, this draws on personal excellence/greatness (including professional skills) but requires that you go further to hone business, strategic and financial acumen - not to mention strong engagement skills. This calls to mind Anne Mulcahy who as she assumed the responsibilities of CEO of Xerox was aided in developing financial acumen by an employee in the finance department. Or of Ginni Rometty, who received mentorship on developing external strategic relationships in the months before stepping into the CEO role at IBM. As I point out in No Ceiling, No Walls , putting on the mantle of leadership is absolutely necessary for success at work - no matter your level. The demands of today's volatile marketplace means that everyone is paid to lead - to use her personal greatness to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others. By all means, lhone your personal greatness or excellence. And continue on. Cultivate your professional excellence and your leadership excellence. These together will help you succeed in life and work. ]] Career advice received by women covers only 2/3 of the success equation in business. This Missing 33%TM has serious implications for a womans chances of being seen as high potential, receiving promotions to senior positions, receiving optimal benefits from mentoring relationships and nurturing the next generation of women leaders. Background Leading Women recently asked over 2000 women, Whats the best career advice youve received? The verbatim responses they submitted were given by bosses, friends, parents, mentors, colleagues and others. We analyzed these responses and found an entire category of advice that women havent been given  a category that creates barriers to career success. Why? Unless on a specialized technical track, people are promoted on the basis of their perceived potential and success as a leader. So, what does this mean? As defined in the book No Ceiling, No Walls , and used by managers in F500 companies including Sunoco, PepsiCo, DePuy/JJ, Amgen, Pfizer and others : Leadership is using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others. This is a definition in which all 3 parts are required for success. Using the greatness in you  this means tapping the essential best of who you are, your strengths, knowledge and attributes; leading in alignment with espoused values, and more. To achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes  this means hitting or exceeding the outcomes that your organization has determined are important for its current and future success in the marketplace. Elements of this include business acumen, strategic acumen and financial acumen. By engaging the greatness in others  means engaging others positive aspects such as hope, creativity, commitment, egalitarianism, compassion (as opposed to their most negative such as hatred, fear, bigotry, etc.) and aligning them to key outcomes. All 3 elements are interdependent and balance is necessary among them. For example, someone who achieves outcomes by commanding it out of their people (lack of focus on engaging others) doesnt meet the definition of leader and will ultimately cost the company money due to high turnover. Someone who over-focuses on engaging others without attention to outcomes will direct happy sailors on a sinking ship. And someone who over-focuses on personal growth will ultimately be out of a job. It follows, then, that the success equation has 3 factors: Use Personal Greatness Achieve and Sustain Outcomes Engage the Greatness in Others The Success Equation in Practice What do executives and boards look for in high potential candidates and candidates for C-suite positions? For answers Leading Women analyzed key factors from Leaders at All Levels: Deepening the Talent Pool to Solve the Succession Crisis by Ram Charan , Boards at Work by Ram Charan , Building Better Boards by Beth Behan and David Nadler and interviews with executives. We then assigned each factor to the related 1/3 rd of the leadership definition. Heres what we found. Of the factors: 50% relate to Achieve and Sustain Outcomes 27% relate to Engage the Greatness in Others 23% relate to Use Personal Greatness In essence, when identifying high potential candidates for career advancement, executives and boards look for people with business and strategic acumen by a factor of nearly 2 to 1. This is significantly out of line with the advice that women are given about career success. ]] Resilience - the ability to overcome challenges and turn them into opportunities - may be the new criterion for professional advancement, according to Accenture. A global research study entitled Women Leaders and Resilience: Perspectives from the C-Suite, reports that more than two-thirds (71%) of surveyed senior level executives report that resilience is critical in determining employee retainability during an economic downturn. Moreover, these leaders view women as slightly more resilient than men and are providing their female professionals with programs to develop resilience. There is one key question within the research: Is one born with resilience or can resilience be learned? Accenture's study finds that resilience can be learned. As with other leadership competencies, resilience is comprised of a set of skills and knowledge that you can develop through disciplined practice. To understand resilience in the context of leadership, it is important to have a starting definition of leadership. According to Susan Colantuono, CEO and founder of Leading Women and author of No Ceiling No Walls, "Leadership is using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness of others" Using this definition, here are 5 steps you can take to enhance your resilience: Use the greatness in you 1. Focus on your strengths . In the face of adversity remember the strengths that have gotten you where you are and ask how can they be applied to overcome the current challenge. 2. Be a "winner. Theres no whining in business, so practice looking for and proposing solutions , instead of simply identifying problems. 3. Stay healthy. Stressful situations are the time to remain focused on your physical, mental and emotional health. Take action to eat right, get the sleep you need, remember to breathe, focus on gratitude and appreciation and all the other actions you know are important to a healthy life. Achieve and sustain outcomes 4. Be "for the business. Understand the outcomes that tell the story of your organization's health and look for innovative ways to improve them even in the face of difficulties. Here, your understanding of the business of the business and the relationships between cash, growth, return and customer become key. For more on this, buy yourself a copy of No Ceiling, No Walls . Engage the greatness in others 5. Deliver a future-focused message of hope. Our work with CEOs during the crash of 2009 and the subsequent great recession shows that the most effective are those who, even in the face of devastating financials, kept their organizations focused on the future by communicating faith in their teams along with hope for and a path toward the future. You have everything it takes to strengthen your leadership resilience. Using our 3-part definition of leadership will help you focus on taking the right steps. Lead ON! Victoria ]] There are many things that women haven't been told about leadership from career-start to the corporate boardroom. I wrote an entire book about them, but there are 9 fundamental things about leadership that women haven't been told and need to know. They are these. 1. Leadership is simple, but it's not easy. It's simple if you have a definition of leadership that is useful and prescriptive. This is the first of 9 things that every woman should know about leadership: "Leadership is using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others." This definition is one you can use to make plans at the start of each day or evaluate actions at the end of each day. Acts of leadership involve standing on the foundation of personal greatness, focusing on achieving key outcomes and engaging others in achieving those outcomes. Beyond that, 8 other things that women haven't been told about leadership include: 2. Conventional wisdom about leadership leads women astray. Conventional wisdom - because of its roots in a time when there were virtually no women being studied - overemphasizes one of the 3 elements of leadership: interpersonal skills. The implicit message is that if you have strong interpersonal skills (which women do), you will get to the top. This is inaccurate (see #3). 3. Business skills are essential to leadership and career success. This is The Missing 33%TM of the career success equation for women. In order to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes women need business acumen, strategic acumen and financial acumen. 4. Precise understanding and use of the word leader will solidify an understanding of leadership . When any random person in a management or executive position is called a leader (even if s/he doesn't fit the definition), it confounds your understanding of leadership. All companies have executive teams, but not all have leadership teams. 5. There's value in distrusting the idea of " leader versus manager ." Great acts of business leadership require that executives and managers both "do the right thing" and "do things right"; engage hearts and minds and efforts!  It is unhelpful to define a leader (one who does the right things and engages hearts and minds) by saying it's not a manager (one who does things right and engages effort). 6. Traditional leadership development programs aren't equally effective for men and women. Because they tend to overemphasize interpersonal skills and underemphasize business savvy, traditional leadership development programs underserve the needs of women. 7. Wearing the mantle of leadership means acting like a business owner rather than as an employee . By donning the mantle of leadership at whatever level, from individual contributor to executive, you are looking for what you can do for the business rather what the business can do for you. 8. To move up you must understand how leadership differs by levels. What you see depends on where you stand. In order to understand how to move to the next level you have to understand how leadership in the job you seek looks to the manager above it! 9. Use the skill of disciplined practice to excel at leadership. Leadership is a set of learnable skills that can be improved through the hard work of disciplined practice. You need the intention to improve, discipline to seek, receive and analyze feedback on your performance; and the opportunity to repeat activities and gauge improvement. Armed with these 9 fundamental points about leadership, you are better equipped to chart a career with no ceiling and no walls. Though it's not easy...it is simple! ]] Darn, there it is again -- the pervasive advice that 50% of what you need to succeed in business is people skills. This time in a column written by famed executive coach, Marshall Goldsmith. He wrote: "...your people skills often make the difference in how high you go. Who would you rather have as a CFO? A moderately good accountant who is great with people ...or a brilliant accountant who's inept with [people]... The candidate with superb people skills will win out every time, in large part because he (e.a.) will be able to...lead." Oddly enough, these stories refer over and over again to "he." Hmm, could there be something about this formula that works for men, but not for women? Most assuredly! Today's conventional wisdom about leadership is based on research and the resultant models conducted and rooted in the 70's when nearly all the leaders in U.S. corporations were men and when the way of thinking was an either/or worldview. For example, managers were either focused on tasks or focused on relationships. This worldview works to the disadvantage of women leaders because it creates a bipolar choice set. You are either good at your job (in Goldsmith's column "a brilliant accountant") or you are a good people person. The inference is always that if you can be both, you will rise to the top of the company. In other words, the formula that arose from the 70's was 50% people skills + 50% technical competence = 100% career success. This formula doesn't work for women. If it did, many more women would hold senior level positions. Why? Because research comparing the performance evaluations of men and women in similar positions, with similar tenure and in similar companies indicates that women outperform men in the area of interpersonal skills. In fact, Business Week called attention to these findings in its November 20, 2000 issue with a cover story titled, "As Leaders, Women Rule". If interpersonal skills are so important and if women consistently outperform men in this skill set, why don't women hold many more seats at the top of organizations? Because people skills and professional competence aren't two halves of a whole. Together they make up only 66% of the whole story. Yes, interpersonal skills are important. Yes, professional competence is important. And, yes, using both to achieve results is important. But what trumps them all is business acumen . That's the missing 33% that isn't talked about. That's the skill set where men are consistently rated by bosses as outperforming women. And, that's the skill set that the majority of leadership development programs ignore. Knowing this, here are 4 steps to filling in the missing 33%: Get thee to a bookstore and buy a copy of Ram Charan's little classic, What the CEO Wants You to Know . It's a primer for business acumen in less than 150 pages. While you're at it, buy a copy of my book, No Ceiling, No Walls , too. Using the knowledge you've gained from the books, sit down and figure out how the area you manage contributes (or could contribute more) to cash generation, profitable growth, customer acquisition/service/retention and return (profit x velocity). Work at this until you can draw a clear line of sight from the work of your employees to the key business outcomes for your organization. Learn the difference between activities, results and outcomes -- and drive for outcomes . (You'll find out about that in No Ceiling, No Walls .) Learn how to talk to your boss, colleagues, direct reports, and strangers who might want to hire you, about how your leadership contributes to the business of your business. We call this, speaking the language of powerTM. That's the 33% solution. Add this to your already outstanding interpersonal skills and professional competence and you have a winning combination. ]] Riding toward our campsite at the head of the Gardiner River in Yellowstone National Park, Vickie points across a valley to the top of a hill. "Theres a Grizzly up there," she says. I think, "Wow, thats amazing!" I had never seen a Grizzly in the wild in any of my 5 trips to Montana over the past 10 years. Then I think of a warning a friend received when riding in Alaska. "Dont lag behind the group along the trail. A Grizzly is less likely to attack a cluster of riders than a lone rider." This is a particularly helpful thought  Im riding in the rear of the group! Then I remember what Mike and Erin told us last year, "If a horse dies in the back country, the outfitter notifies the Park Service and they dynamite the carcass." "Why do they do that?" I asked. "So that bears and wolves dont develop a taste for horse meat." Now, thats comforting - at least the bears not thinking hed like a little horse doeuvre (sic). As we ride along, it seems reassuringly evident that the bear on the other side of the valley was happily engaged in an eating orgy and totally oblivious to us. A Grizzly Encounter The next night Vickie calls us from the campfire, Look, theres a Grizzly in the river. And what a beauty  a large silver-backed specimen. Now this Grizzly  in spite of seeming totally preoccupied with fishing - is a little too close for comfort. Excitement mixes with fear in most of us. H.A. Moore (our outfitter) and Justin (my son) make sure all the food is immediately put in the panniers and hung out of reach. The rest of us grab cameras and binoculars and watch the bear amble into and out of the stream, heading in the general direction of the campsite. Justin joins us, but H. A. sits comfortably by the fire, bear spray at the ready. As the bear crosses the river and comes closer and closer, Justin asks, "Whats the range of the bear spray?" "Oh, about 20 feet," H.A. answers. "Riiiight... just enough to end up with a really angry bear 20 feet away," Justin jokes. "Oh dont worry," H.A. replies "the mules will drive the bear off." Hmm. Interesting. A Grizzly run off by mules? Seems unlikely, since theyre contentedly grazing. Grazing is what equines do best. If you were into corporate-speak, you could say its one of their core competencies. Seems unlikely too, because, in the grand scheme of things, mules are prey. Come to think of it, equines other core competence is running in a straight line away from predators! But, hey, H.A.s the leader here. Seems he should know what hes talking about. Time for a little trust...a little risk-taking. So we all stand near camp watching, taking photos and nervously laughing about what were doing. Minutes go by and the bear is getting closer and closer. He crosses to our side of the river. And still the herd quietly grazes. The mules will run off the bear? Riiiiight. Seems about as likely as snow in August. Suddenly the lead mule catches sight or wind of the bear. The mule raises his head from the lush grass, looks attentively at the bear and takes a few steps toward it. Then, the mule stands still, ears forward  tuned into the threat in its territory. A short while later a couple of the other mules catch on to the fact that the leader isnt grazing any more, raise their heads, see the bear, and walk calmly over to the lead mule, focused intently on the bear. A few seconds pass...then the lead horse joins the mules. Then two more follow. And then a few more. After a couple of minutes nearly the whole herd is gathered watching the bear. Then, to no visible signal, the herd starts walking toward the bear  they actually seem curious about that Grizzly, but the interest isnt reciprocated. Wanting nothing to do with the equines, the Griz lumbers away, followed by the herd until hes out of their territory. One by one the mules and horses each drop their heads and return to grazing. Leadership Encounter? So, what makes this a leadership encounter of the Grizzly kind? As leader for the larger unit, H. A. knew the strengths of all his team members, people and equines alike. He knew that mules are more territorial than horses and capable of marshaling the herd to run off a Grizzly bear. So while we were nervously watching, he sat relaxed, trusting them to do their job. As followers, none of us had met H. A. before this trip. We each took a risk and put our trust in him on the basis of his competence and reputation. For two days, his behavior validated the wisdom of our trust. While we were slightly nervous about facing this Grizzly situation, none of us panicked  he had given us no reason to question his leadership. Within the larger unit of outfitter, crew, and riders, the herd was a sub-team. Within the team it was the lead mare that took the herd to various venues for grazing. Facing this environmental threat, a more territorial mule took the lead. The mule moved forward to study the threat and took no action until the time was right. It was soon joined by a small number (about 20%) of the rest of the herd. These like-minded "team members" werent coerced into a change from grazing (business as usual) to addressing the environmental threat  they went along zealously. The 20% acted as enough of a pull to motivate change in the others. The leader didnt have to kick, bite, herd, or otherwise command and control the "team" into action. Within a very short time the majority of the rest of the herd had stopped grazing and had joined the leader. Once the lead mule took action, it didnt get distracted  it walked resolutely toward the bear with the majority of the herd joining in. The few stragglers finally gave up on grazing and linked up with the herd as it moved toward the Grizzly. The stragglers realized that their survival depended on not being left behind. Within the human sub-team, the leader was able to give credible assurances about his sub-teams performance. Within the equine sub-team, the inherent strengths and leadership qualities of one of the team members enabled the group to recognize a threat in its environment, stop business-as-usual, and mobilize to overcome the threat. Leadership Lessons What lessons can a leader take from our encounter of a Grizzly kind? Know the strengths of each of your team members and let them do work that taps their unique strengths. H.A. knew that the mules were territorial, wouldn't take kindly to a Grizzly in their campsite, and would actually run the bear off if it came too close. Be trustworthy, competent, clear, consistent, and courageous -- and people will want to be with you. H.A. was able to lead the human sub-team because he was competent and had earned our trust. The lead mule (or a lead mare) becomes the "lead" because the other equines trust its judgment, know the boundaries, and want to be with it. Scan your business environment for opportunities or threats. To be a leader you can't be focused solely on the work at hand. It's part of your job to scan the environment by networking, running "what-if" scenarios, seeking innovation and best practices in order to identify and capitalize on a threat or opportunity. Maintain focus on a threat or opportunity until the course of action is clear. When the vitality of her business is threatened or can be enhanced, a great leader isn't distracted by inconsequential matters When leading change, clearly indicate your intended actions and invest energy wisely. Zealots (like-minded team members) will be with you from the start. A compelling clear messages will engage the willing workers (those who, at first, might not see things the way you do, but are willing to be engaged). The complacents will need the most attention, but can be drawn along by informal leaders among the zealots and willing workers. Don't invest your energy on the hostages (team members who will resist change to the very last minute). They will either come along to survive or they will have to be managed into different positions or a different organization. The next afternoon a Grizzly again appeared on the other side of the river. We watched it for a while and then went about our campfire conversations. No cameras, no binoculars, no nervous conversation -- we had learned that the mules and horses would keep us safe. The leadership encounter of a Grizzly kind taught us that leadership lessons can come straight from the horse's (mule's) mouth! ]] Women leaders consistently rate higher than men as managers of people but are consistently rated lower in the area of strategic acumen. Although strategic acumen must be exercised on a daily basis, one organizational ritual presents the perfect opportunity for honing and demonstrating these skills -- the annual planning process. In order to exercise and showcase your strategic acumen, you will want to plan like a CEO no matter at the level you lead. There are four essential skills and attributes required in order to plan like a CEO: "Soft eyes," Strategic thinking, Understanding the "business of the business," Process ownership skills. Planning like a CEO is an "outside-in" process. You begin by assessing the business environment and your organization's response to it in order to determine how your current department/function/business must change to respond to it. This is the opposite of most organizations' "inside-out" process of making incremental changes to current operations based on last year's results.You can develop and strengthen the skills needed to plan like a CEO as you lead from any level in the organization. Soft Eyes Soft eyes drive the outside-in dynamic of strategic acumen. If you have soft eyes, you have the ability to be alert for events and trends in the larger business environment and to discriminate between those that are high-impact and those that are not. Like the ripples caused by a pebble tossed into a lake, events in the larger business environment will impact your organization. Being able to discern, from an infinite number, those events and trends that will have the greatest impact on your organization is essential. A woman leader with soft eyes will be able to "register" a bomb explosion on a train in Spain, the strength of the Euro against the dollar, and the trend to offshore white-collar jobs. From these she will be able to determine which have the highest potential for impacting her customers, her suppliers, her competitors, and her organization. What, if any, events and trends in the business environment register to your soft eyes as events that will impact the function(s)/organization you lead? Which events and trends are likely to have the highest impact? Strategic Thinking Strategic thinking means connecting the dots between the high-impact events and trends youve assessed and your organization. Strategic thinking enables women executives to answer questions such as: How best should my organization deal with the high-impact events and trends? Which factors can we influence (e.g. legislation, regulation, customer demand, competitive threats), and in what ways? Which factors should we simply respond to, or cope with? What are the degrees of freedom we have, and how can we use them most effectively? How do we translate these possibilities into key strategies for the organization? Will these strategies create competitive advantage that will sustain our business? At lower levels, you exercise your strategic thinking by creating a clear line of sight between the function or department you lead and the strategies of the larger organization. You must be able to answer the question, "How can my function/department/team drive those strategies?" Business Acumen Understanding the business of the business allows you to set clear goals and create meaningful measures. It is imperative that you understand how the function(s) you lead contribute to your company's growth, availability of cash, customer acquisition and retention, and return (profit margin x velocity). If you are the CEO, you must be skilled at paying attention to all four and appropriately shifting your focus to areas that are out of balance. At lower levels, you must understand your department/function/team's role in driving each area. By understanding the numbers behind the organization's strategies, you can then define clear outcomes, the concrete measures that indicate your success in achieving them and the specific processes within your control that drive those outcomes. Process Ownership Process ownership skills , or execution, comprise the major job of a business leader. The skills discussed so far are meaningless if you don't have the ability to execute. As leaders, businesswomen own three types of processes which, if managed well, enable the organization to execute its plans: people processes, operations processes and strategic processes. Plenty has been written about the leader's role vis a vis the people processes. Not much has been written about the leaders as owners of operating or strategic processes. Leaders who are capable process owners are skilled at making the connections between the high-level strategies, the specific processes and measures that can deliver higher customer service, higher margins, improved velocity and accelerated growth, and specific programs and initiatives which will improve processes to deliver the intended results. This is the bottom line of an effective strategic planning process: defining the initiatives that must be successfully executed next year to permanently and sustainably improve your business. As time moves inexorably toward most organizations' planning cycles, take the opportunity to assess and hone your soft eyes, strategic thinking skills, business acumen and process ownership skills. Move from a scan of the external business environment to the definition of initiatives that will improve the business. Having enhanced your ability to plan like a CEO, you will be able to produce an integrated plan that delivers key outcomes and showcases your strategic acumen. ]] Leadership isnt something you wait to do when you become a CEO. Lead now or forever hold your place! I was in D.C. facilitating a strategic planning meeting. The new CEO walked into the room, sat down with the senior managers and said, "Id like each of you to give me an estimate of the percent of time you spend managing operations and the percent you spend identifying strategic opportunities to improve the organization." One by one they replied and a pattern became clear. They were spending about 80% of their time attending to existing operations and 20% on strategic opportunities. "Not good enough. I expect you to spend 70% looking for strategic opportunities to improve the organizations margin, service and market share and 30% on operations," he challenged. I knew these managers. Their VP described all of them as good performers . "After all," he said, "they meet their goals every year." And several of them were focused on changing and improving their operations  though several of them were not. Yet even those who were focused on operational improvements didnt describe themselves as identifying strategic opportunities to improve margin, service and market share. Why? Is it because they werent making strategic improvements to impact key metrics? Not necessarily. But certainly, its because they didnt understand the business of their business and couldnt describe the clear line of sight between what they were doing and the key outcomes of the organization. Can these managers be described as leading? In the eyes of the CEO, no. Can they become good leaders? In some cases, yes. What will it take? Great leaders, at any level of the organization (from individual contributor, to supervisor, to manager to executive) understand with increasing clarity the business of their business. They know what key measures are indicators of organizational performance. They know how they and their reporting teams drive those metrics. They are able to conceptualize their work in this larger strategic context and to seek the right opportunities for driving measures in the right direction. Without this understanding, no matter how good your performance is, no matter how well you hit your numbers, no matter how frequently you meet deadlines, no matter how many hours you invest; you are ultimately not going to be viewed as a leader. You will be stuck right where you are! So, no matter your current level in the organization, learn the business of your business. Whats the process stream that generates cash? Who are your key external stakeholders and how do they measure your organizations performance? What are the key internal indicators of organizational performance and where you can find them? What customers is your business targeting and what are the organizations acquisition and retention strategies? Then, whether you are an individual contributor or have reporting staff(s), learn how to view your responsibilities in this larger strategic context. Ask yourself questions such as: Can I draw a direct line between what Im responsible for and those measures? Do I make this direct line clear to my reporting staffs and/or colleagues? Do I treat as high priority my activities that have the greatest impact on these measures? Do I help my reporting staffs and/or colleagues stay focused on these priorities Am I focused on improving processes in order to drive these measures? Do I keep my staff and/or colleagues focused on improving processes to drive these measures? If you can answer yes to these questions, you are positioned to lead. If you cant, you arent. In other words, learn the business of your business and lead now, or forever hold your place! ]] In the quiet of a Sunday afternoon, I savor the book descriptions in my Bas Bleu catalog. One title in particular jumps off the page. Sprezzatura: Fifty Ways Italian Genius Shaped the World. Being Italian-American, I am obviously destined to like the title, but I am intrigued by something more. Sprezzatura. I try the word on for size; it tickles my fancy and rolls around in my mouth. Reading the blurb that describes the book I discover that sprezzatura means "the art of effortless mastery". "Aha!" I think, "This single word describes an important component of leadership greatness." Early in my career I led an important IT project. I was always the youngest person and the only woman in a group of men. I prepared for each meeting with intensity and still felt awkward each and every time I walked into the room with these older, and sometimes dismissive men. Fast-forward a few years. I was sitting in a similar group of men launching a high stakes project. Suddenly, I had the shocking realization that I was, even as the only woman in the room, totally comfortable leading the project. Somehow, in the intervening years I had made the transition from agonizing effort to effortless mastery -- sprezzatura! What does it take to get to the point of leading with sprezzatura? One answer lies in another word I discovered the same week. Reading Seth Godin's provocative book Purple Cow: Transform your Business by Being Remarkable , I came across the Japanese word otaku. Godin writes: " Otaku describes something that's more than a hobby but a little less than an obsession. Otaku is the overwhelming desire that gets someone to drive across town to try a new ramen-noodle shop that got a great review.... People read Fast Company because they have an otaku about business. They visit trade shows to stay on the cutting edge -- not just to help their company survive, but because they like that edge. " I "get" the idea of otaku. I read management books because I have an otaku about leadership and innovation. I have an otaku about leadership lessons from horses. And, I admit to having an otaku about the scones at the The Bakery in Charlestown, RI. My experiences with widely diverse leaders tell me that otaku about leadership or business or change is a prerequisite for great leadership. Leadership must be something that's more than a hobby, certainly more than an external validation of your worth, but less than an obsession. I think it would be safe to say that the Level 5 leaders in Jim Collins' Good to Great (and the Warren Buffet CEO's) had an otaku about their success of their companies. In our programs on leadership development for women, we often talk about what the participants love about leadership. I tell them that in order to be great leaders they must love their work or love their company or love their industry or love their profession or believe that what they do is important or love winning or love playing the game. In other words, have otaku about what they do in their organizations. It's easier to become great at something that we have an otaku about. If we have otaku about leadership, we are likely to move into that state of effortless mastery - to lead with sprezzatura. To know the "right" thing to say or do without conscious thought. To be "in the zone" as we execute our leadership activities. To feel comfortable in any leadership situation. So, when you think about what drives leadership excellence, remember the sprezzatura of Italian geniuses and the Japanese word otaku! ]] I recently read a book in which the author claims that changing a culture is like turning an aircraft carrier. I frankly think his simile totally misses the mark. For starters, an aircraft carrier is quite nimble for its size and turning it is actually quite simple. The Junior Officer of the Deck (JOOD) gives orders to the helmsman (who controls the rudder) about the direction of the turn and to the lee helmsman (who controls the engines) about the speed of the turn. Unlike other large ships, an aircraft carrier has 4 engines and can turn very quickly (even within its own length) by reversing two screws while the others are moving forward. This makes turning an aircraft carrier child's play when compared to changing a culture. Here are my top 5 reasons why culture change is more difficult. 5. "Business as Usual" is Not Allowed : On an aircraft carrier, there are whole groups of crew members who conduct business as usual while the JOOD and helmsmen are charting and setting a new course. Not so in a culture change. Successful culture change involves everyone at every level of every department. "Business as usual" is not allowed. No department is untouched. Everyone must live the change...or leave. Everyone, especially managers, needs the insight, creativity and courage to say this process isn't working any more or I can think of a better way to do this - and then to take action to change processes, policies and systems. 4. Checklists Not Available : Because aircraft carrier crews change with new enlistments (and for other reasons) the steps, tools and techniques for turning a carrier are well codified - and they are transferable between carriers of the same class. Not so with culture change. Culture change is unique to each organization - there are no checklists. The steps, tools and techniques that are successful in one organization don't automatically transfer to another. 3. It's Not About Mechanisms, It's About Hearts and Minds : Turning an aircraft carrier involves engaging mechanisms (rudder and engines). Culture change means engaging hearts and minds. It requires personal change...from everyone! Consider this quote, " People will accept management's conclusions, but people will act on their own conclusions ." It tells us that when people can answer the questions why is the organization changing? and what does the change require of me? , they become part of the transformation thus accelerate the change. This creates a force for change that no aircraft carrier can claim. 2. Every Manager for Her/Himself...Not! On an aircraft carrier many officers can be successful at their jobs without being involved with the helmsmen and JOOD. Not so in an organization. The force for change that can be harnessed when staff members act on their own conclusions is accelerated by managers who are focused on helping each other succeed. Looking for cross-departmental improvement opportunities, recognizing staff for aligned behavior - even if they don't report to you - and refraining from casting blame on other departments are examples of the fact that we change together or we fail together. 1. And the number 1 reason that changing a culture is not like turning an aircraft carrier... It's Not About Command Control : When turning an aircraft carrier the JOOD issues a series of comands that are followed to the letter and the carrier (all things being equal) changes course. In a culture change, leaders at all levels have to not only engage and align staff (see #3 above), but also have to be role models for the change. If turning an aircraft carrier is child's play compared to changing a culture, what's changing a culture like? I would say it's like training a horse, but that's a discussion for a different article. I thank a friend who is a retired Naval officer for providing details about what happens when the JOOD, who typically has the con, turns an aircraft carrier. ]] Lipstick, diamonds and Gucci won't advance women in their careers. Nor will useful, but insufficient, advice on work/life balance, resilience or authenticity. Women are given abundant advice on how to look and how to be, but it only gets them so far. There's a not-so-little hidden secret that women aren't being told about career success. After years of studying women at all levels in organizations, I've found that there is a rarely discussed element that holds women back...or propels them ahead. It is one element where they are consistently rated as under-performing their male counterparts. It is one element missing from (or under-taught in) most organizations' leadership development programs. This one element is the vital missing piece of the success equation for women. I call it The Missing 33%TM. It is business savvy with all its related skills and knowledge. For years the traditional career success equation has been something like this: Professional Competence + Interpersonal Skills = Career Success. This is one reason that many corporate leadership development programs focus so heavily on interpersonal skills. But these are the very skills at which women generally excel. Which raises the question, if women have such strong interpersonal skills, why are there so few women at the top of organizations? In part because these leadership development programs are built on an incomplete success equation. Therefore, they woefully underemphasize the most important career success driver: business savvy. In studies from around the globe, business savvy is one area where women are rated as underperforming men. That women have less business savvy than men is a strong expectation. In company after company from F10 to mid-sized firms we've found that women are under-prepared to confront this expectation. This creates a significant career derailer - but one that can be easily overcome by filling in The Missing 33%.. What does it take to fill in The Missing 33%? Women need to acquire, develop and demonstrate skills in 3 areas: Business acumen and the related ability to speak the Language of PowerTM Strategic acumen - the ability to understand, set, evaluate and execute strategy Financial acumen - the ability to read the story of business performance that's told by the numbers By buying into the belief that interpersonal skills and personal competence will carry them to the top, women will hit a plateau while resting on the laurels of their skills at engaging others. As long as women buy into the fashionistas' sales-driven message that how they look will make or break their career, women will invest more time and money in lipstick, diamonds and Gucci than in professional development of the business savvy kind. When it comes to women's advancement, lipstick, diamonds, Gucci - and even interpersonal skills - aren't enough! For career success, women must grab hold of The Missing 33%. ]] There's a not-so-little hidden secret that women aren't being told about career success. It's a rarely discussed element that holds women back...or propels them ahead. It's one element on which they are consistently rated as under-performing their male counterparts. It is one element missing from (or under-taught in) most organizations' leadership development programs - and frequently totally absent from the activities of women's networks, affinity groups or leadership forums.

To successfully advance women, learning development and diversity functions will strengthen the pipeline of women by offering The Missing 33%. ]] Fashionistas would have women believe that what we wear, the accessories we use and how we look are keys to executive presence. Why? Because thats how they sell products - and most of us know by now that women make or influence 85% of all consumer purchases. But in the context of executive presence, this emphasis on personal appearance can lead women astray. Appearance isnt the same as executive presence. Presentation skills arent the sole factor in executive presence. And, further, executive presence is different from personal presence. So what aren't women being told about executive presence. Before revealing the secret, it helps to understand Personal Presence as distinct from Executive Presence . Many people have personal presence; TV and movie stars, politicians, social movement leaders, speakers, preachers and others. They need personal presence because they must be comfortable being in the limelight. For this reason, personal presence can be defined as the ability to comfortably draw and hold attention while delivering a message . But, do movie stars, speakers, preachers, social movement leaders have executive presence . Most senior managers, executives and directors would say no. So, there must be a difference between personal presence and executive presence. Here it is... Executive presence is the ability to comfortably draw and hold attention while delivering a business-savvy message . A business- savvy message is what differentiates the movie star with personal presence from the CEO or senior manager (or for that matter manager, supervisor or individual contributor) with executive presence. Heres why this distinction is important. Cultivating personal presence is necessary, but insufficient when it comes to being seen as having executive presence. At every level, you need executive presence (which can also be called leadership presence) in order to engage and align others and to deliver on your organizations goals. Executive presence helps you be seen as credible and competent by your employees, colleagues and bosses. Especially those up the management chain. When filling positions, the person with executive presence will win out over the person with personal presence...or no presence at all. Why? Because they demonstrate that they understand the business of the business! Recently at a client site a manager described this in action. She described the dynamics of a meeting where managers were reporting to executives. The managers whose reports were long on adjectives and short on metrics got a ho hum response from the executives  no matter how eloquent their reports. The managers whose reports focused on numbers critical to the bottom line caught the executives attention who picked up their pens and took notes. This is one example of why executive presence matters! And why mistaking appearance for executive presence is a mis-direction for women. Even former eBay CEO, Meg Whitman, says about herself No one would say that Im fashion forward. So while fashion and womens media misdirects us with its emphasis on appearance, where else can we turn to learn about executive presence? Google. I analyzed the first 100 pieces of advice from the first 20 Google returns for executive presence and broke it down by category. Heres what I found. 78% of the advice was about how to enhance personal presence, in other words, how to comfortably draw and hold attention while delivering a message. This is important, but incomplete advice that covered 4 categories: 1. How to Be : candid, sincere, self-confident, calm, passionate charismatic, thoughtful, courageous, warm etc. 2. How to Speak : deep voice, succinct, avoid qualifiers 3. Non-Verbal Communication : posture, eye contact, gestures, facial expressions 4. Appearance : pay for a total makeover, look polished. And the men whose advice was among the first 20 returns, NEVER mentioned appearance! A meager 12% of the advice focused on speaking the language of business - the single most important element that differentiates personal from executive presence. This list is in inverse proportion to what women need to be told about executive presence! To the people for whom executive presence matters most - people UP your reporting chain - the most important aspect of executive presence is the one thats least discussed - what you say, your business-savvy messages. ]] Christine walked into her coaching session and before she even sat down she said, Im very nervous about a conversation I have to have with Jack who is constantly making disparaging comments about his co-workers. Whats your desired outcome for the conversation? I asked her. What do you mean? she asked. I tried again, Why are you having this conversation with Jack? To tell him how I feel about the disparaging comments he makes. They upset me. Yesterday I heard him tell Fred hes an idiot and overheard him say that Tina is a dolt. she replied looking at me as if I, myself, were an absolute idiot. I had a very important reason for asking Christine what outcome she sought for the conversation. Many managers dont engage in strategic communication. They dont know what core message they must deliver  and they especially lose sight of their core message when having difficult conversations. They let their discomfort with the conversation get in the way of their effectiveness. And Christines answer indicated to me that she was no different than many of her colleagues. She was focused on her anxiety about the activity she faced  the conversation with Jack. She didnt understand that she had in front of her a great opportunity for strategic communication. And she was confused about the concepts of activities, results and outcomes as they related to the situation at hand. As I coached her through a discussion about the situation she came to realize that her expression of disapproval for Jacks disparaging comments was an activity intended to produce a result (that the employee would commit to stopping and to actually stop making disparaging comments). But the real reason she wanted to have a conversation with Jack was to create and sustain the important organizational outcome of service excellence (customer delight). To achieve the organizational outcome, she realized that the discussion had to accomplish 4 things. Jack would have to: recognize the value to himself of stopping his disparaging comments, commit to changing his behavior, work on better teamwork in service of the teams goals for service excellence and  customer satisfaction, and expect that she would be monitoring his behavior in order to recognize his respectful interactions and counsel him in the case of a disparaging comment. Theres another goal that you need to have for this discussion. Theres a superordinate goal for ALL conversations leaders have with employees. What do you think that is? I probed further. Well, Christine paused, I always want the employee to feel good about any conversation I have with him or her. How realistic is it that the employee will always feel good? If thats an goal you have,  you run the risk of sugar-coating important messages. Ive seen many managers get tripped up on this and say things like its not so bad or dont feel bad about this. That minimizes the important change you are asking the employee to make.  You dont want to do that, so whats a more realistic overarching goal? I sat quietly while Christine thought for a while. I want the employee to feel whole and respected after the conversation. she answered. Great answer. You now have 5 goals you want from your conversation with Jack. Theyre what will transform the conversation from a personal complaint about your discomfort with his behavior to a strategic communication  the kind of communication that great leaders have.  Lets role play the interaction youre going to have with Jack. As we talked and role played the discussion, Christine successfully transformed the essence of her message from I feel upset when I hear you make disparaging comments about your co-workers to  The purpose of our unit is to deliver service to our customers, the whole team must work together to make that happen and your success here depends on your respectful treatment of your coworkers. When you make disparaging comments, like telling Lou that Tina is a dolt or calling Fred an idiot, you threaten your own success, the teams effectiveness and ultimately the service we provide our customers. Youre an important part of the team and I want you to be successful. Tell me what youre going to do differently in the future? A few weeks later, Christine called to tell me that her conversation with Jack had gone very well and she was noticing an improvement in his behavior. What are you doing about it? I asked. What do you mean? she countered. Obviously, Christine was doing the right thing by monitoring Jacks behavior and noticing an improvement, but I wanted to know if she were reinforcing his efforts to change his behavior? If she were not, she was risking being seen as one of those managers who only comment on employee performance when theyre doing something wrong. To be a great leader, she would also have to catch employees doing something right. So I asked, Christine, have you told Jack that you notice a change in his behavior and what a positive difference its making? Well, no, I havent thought to do that. Remember our conversation, what were the outcomes you wanted from the discussion? I wanted Jack to recognize the value to himself of stopping his disparaging comments, commit to changing his behavior, work on better teamwork in service of the teams purpose of customer satisfaction, feel whole and respected, and expect that I would be monitoring his behavior in order to recognize his respectful interactions and counsel in the case of a disparaging comment. I was quiet for a minute. I see, Christine said, I really need to give Jack the positive feedback about the change Im observing...and about the positive impact on the team and our service levels. Christine had successfully found the core of her message, not only at the moment of her conversation with Jack, but now as she reflected on his changed pattern of behavior.  Youre absolutely right I said, follow-up is a key element in strategic communication. Its not just confronting behaviors that impede outcomes. Great leaders affirm employee behaviors that are in service of organizational outcomes. Strategic communication is a key differentiator of great leaders. They keep in front of their staffs the key outcomes that the organization must deliver for its health, vitality and growth. They do this in difficult conversations and when giving positive recognition. They strategically communicate every day  not just once a year when they talk about the upcoming years plans and goals. Like Christine, strategic communicators find and hold closely their core message. ]] Yesterday as I worked in my home office, a small herd of young deer came over the stone walls. Two entered the yard. A nibble from the ground here, a nibble from the ground there. Delicate steps, ear-twisting listening, noses seeking the scent of danger. Zip, gone a few tips of lily leaves, a few hydrangea leaves, a few rose leaves. After they left, there was no sign that they had been here. No bare spot of grass, no absent frond of lily leaves, no stripped branch of hydrangea or rose. I was struck by how carefully they steward the land from which they take their sustenance - a lesson I try to live daily as I seek to simplify the material part of life. And then, struck by the invisibility of their presence, I thought of this quote about leadership from Lao Tzu, the father of Taoism. As for the best leaders, the people do not notice their existence... The second best leaders, people honour and praise... The next best leaders, people fear... The next, people hate... When the best leaders work is done the people say, we did it ourselves. Lao-Tzu This truth about leadership, codified at least 2300 years ago, tends to serve women well...sometimes! Humility Many of us are extraordinary leaders by Lao Tzus definition and the accolades of our direct reports. We are empowering of others. We dont take credit that is not our due. We generously share credit with our team. This tends to not be a conscious strategic choice. The fact is, most women dont like to boast and dont like to stand out. We have a tendency to humility. This humility is part of the success equation that Jim Collins describes as characterizing the executives who took their companies from good to great. Collins writes, The essential ingredient for taking a company to greatness is having...an executive in whom extreme personal humility blends paradoxically with intense professional will. The sad fact of the matter is that the people who determine our options for upward mobility arent our direct-reports. They are our bosses  and with rare exception they tend to hold as the model for leadership one of the heroic leader paradigm. I n my research I have identified 3 common heroic leader paradigms: The General Patton paradigm recognizes and favors the command and control type of leader. You recognize the General Patton leader, not only be their tendency toward command and control style of leadership, but also by the reasons they give for not promoting women into senior positions. Most commonly, She wont make the tough decisions. The Moses-from-the-Mountain paradigm recognizes and favors the charismatic visionary. Organizations that seek this type of leader is often criticized for promoting people who look the part over people who get it done. They dont promote women into senior positions because she doesnt fit the bill or  wont play with the money managers, large accounts or someone else. The Lone Ranger paradigm recognizes and favors those who come to the rescue with quick action. The executives who slash and burn, reorganize, or take other dramatic actions. Their favorite rationale for not promoting a woman would be, shes too deliberate, cant act quickly enough. As you might expect, none of these models of leadership include humility as a competence! So, whats a woman to do? She is to think about humility as a strategic choice, not a permanent personality trait. Be humble down, be boastful up. Take credit where credit is due when talking with those who make decisions about your career. Be generous in giving credit where credit is due when talking with your direct reports. AND do both when advocating for the advancement of a protege (someone youre mentoring). In other words, know how to strategically self-promote. Strategic Self-Promotion What does strategic self-promotion look like? Lets say youve just closed a key deal. To make it happen, Sam (a direct report) did a great deal of research about the client company. You were able to use the research to tailor a pitch and to succeed in a lengthy negotiation. The net result? A sale that will mean $1million to your companys bottom line. Now you have a chance to talk to Chris, the CEO at an upcoming event. If your tendency would normally be to say nothing OR to say something like, I want you to know what a great job the team did in landing the XYZ account, zip it! Instead, plan to make a strategic boast. Strategic self-promotioin requires 3 steps. First, take a shot at what leadership paradigm the CEO holds. Second, determine how to weave the biases of that paradigm into a boast. Third, make the boast! A strategic self-promotion to a General Patton paradigm-holder: Chris, I want to let you know that I successfully completed the VERY difficult negotiation with XYZ company. They really tried to push us around, but I drove home a deal that will bring $1 million to the bottom line. Notice the emphasis on your strength in handling a difficult negotiation, in being able to stand up to the push from XYZ and to drive home the deal. To the Moses-from-the-Mount paradigm-holder: Chris, I want to tell you personally that I was able to win XYZ company over to our side during the negotiations. The $1 million profit from the deal will move us closer to the insert something about the vision. Notice the personal message, the compelling win over to your side and the tie to the vision. To the Lone Ranger paradigm-holder: Chris, it was a great move to go after XYZ when we did. They were just realizing that they needed what we sold them and I made the deal before anyone else got to them. The $1million could have gone to competitor if I hadnt begun negotiations when I did. Take note of the fact that you struck while the fire was hot and saved the company from the competitive threat! If youre like Madeleine Albright and you think its a crime to not share credit, youll want to advocate for Sams future. The best way to do this is to a great plug for Sams excellent research into any of the above boasts. BUT do NOT leave the remark about Sam as the final comment. The opening and final comments should be about the work YOU did. Being inclined to humility, these examples of strategic self-promotion might feel alien to you. I long for the day when all organizations recognize the many and complex truths about leadership and understand the power in humility. Until they do, salt your skill set with strategic self-promotion. ]] You've probably heard the saying, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink." In other words, a horse that's led to water will drink only if it's thirsty. While we might be able to guilt a person who isn't thirsty into taking a drink, this saying does hold an important leadership lesson for women. It's this: as a leader we can clearly point someone in the direction of success, performance or achievement, but in the end, the person must be thirsty for success, performance or achievement or no action is taken. There are 5 different engagement strategies that we can use to tickle a person's thirst for success (to learn more about our 5-C Engagement Strategies, pick up a copy of No Ceiling, No Walls ), but regardless of which strategy we employ, our ability to tickle the thirst depends on a combination of words and leadership presence. Leadership presence is comprised of many elements: appearance, dress, confidence, power-talk and non-verbal expression. Work with horses provides an opportunity to focus with laser precision on our non-verbal expression and our ability to moderate the power we radiate. Lessons from a Master I learned this lesson from Harry Whitney ( www.harrywhitney.com ). Harry won't ever call himself a "horse whisperer," but he does see things from the horse's point of view and is fluent in the way of horses. Harry taught me how to prepare horses to be ridden. One day I was working with a very nervous filly. I was using the exact same style that I had previously used with a very laid back young mare. Always one to coach, not direct, Harry's quiet comment was, "Susan, you certainly are projecting a lot of energy." It took me a while to figure out what he meant and why the filly wasn't getting any more tractable. I realized that we always radiate a viscerally discernible presence. Mine was over-the-top for the nervous filly, but it had been at the right level for the laid-back mare. To succeed with the filly, I had to learn to "turn down" the presence I was projecting. I had to broaden my range so I could modulate it as needed. I was lucky to be able to learn this through work with horses. Horses don't understand language, so it's all about presence. As Harry says, you ask with "as little as it takes, but all that it takes." I had to start with the smallest "ask" and then ratchet up my "ask" until I got the desired response. I learned to extend my range from a very energetic, commanding presence to a very calming, small presence -- and to do it all through non-verbal expression. Adjusting our presence to the situation and our "ask" to each individual increases the likelihood that we get the behavior and outcomes we need from those we lead. There are times when our leadership presence has to be at full volume (high energy or commanding), times at low volume (non-threatening or calming) and other times in between. Many women leaders are comfortable at the "low volume" end of the range. Others operate always at the high end. Effectiveness comes in being able to modulate business presence over the full range. So, can you modulate the presence you radiate? Can you change the language of your "ask?" Can you respond to differences in your listeners? Can you effectively reward an employee's "try." Can you lead a horse to water? ]] A few years ago I sat down with an executive coaching client (let's call her Jeanne) who was a new Director of HR. As we discussed her leadership goals and challenges, Jeanne told this story, "Last week my COO walked into my office and said, 'I've had it with George. I want him fired. Make it happen.'" Jeanne went on, "I wasn't comfortable with the demand, but because the COO is my primary customer, I went ahead and did what he wanted." As we discussed the situation a light bulb went off. Because Jeanne loved to ride I could use the metaphor of "riding as leading from the saddle" to help her achieve a deeper understanding of her leadership role. To become a great rider Jeanne would have to lead her horse to ever-increasing standards of performance. This means she first had to be able to envision the standard of performance she sought. Second, she had to understand her role in leading her horse toward it. I took her through an example. "Imagine," I said, "you're riding on a trail and you come to a wooden bridge over a small stream. Instead of walking calmly over the bridge, your horse skitters over it. What would you do?" "I'd keep on riding," Jeanne replied. "Why?" I asked. "Because the stream scared my horse and I would want to go on to calm it down and probably because I'd have my mind on where I was going." "Well, what would that teach the horse?" I asked. After a pause, she answered, "That it's okay to skitter across a bridge." Clearly, that's not a lesson Jeanne wanted her horse to learn. What could she do instead? In order to correct that behavior, she would first have to envision the performance goal: my horse will walk calmly across a bridge over running water. Second, she'd have to really believe that the goal is attainable -- and good for both her and the horse. Third, she must know in-the-moment exactly what she would have to do from the saddle to lead her horse toward that attainable standard of performance. So, what does this have to do with Jeanne's situation? Jeanne actually skittered past a scary situation with the COO. Yes, she had the professional wisdom to be uncomfortable with the COO's request, but she wasn't sure how, as a leader, she should handle it. Why? Because she didn't have a clear vision of what it meant for her to execute her leadership role. She didn't believe that it was possible for her to push back, instead of complying. And she was not able to harness her discomfort and appropriately act in-the-moment. As a leader it was Jeanne's job to bring balance to the COO's request by highlighting the risks of the precipitous act of firing George (who had no documented performance issues and hadn't committed any violation of company policy.). The COO may have prevailed in the end, but her professional leadership responsibility was to discuss the down-side risks. I realized that if I could help Jeanne understand the parallels between leadership at work and leading from the saddle, she would become both a great leader and a great rider. She and I worked together to revisit the situation with the COO, to redefine her leadership role and to enact an appropriate range of responses. We put to good use leadership lessons "straight from the horse's mouth." ]] When it comes to closing the gender gap at the top, we have over 13 years of research, so you can imagine how I struggled to create a 10 minute talk (I failed - it's about 14). But it's the most succinct summary of what we know and you're sure to hear something to help close the gender gap at the top and/or achieve your career goals! Here's my ASK of you. If you value the information, please share the Talk as widely as you can with friends and colleagues, post it on LinkedIN, Facebook, Google+, etc. Share it with your internal women's discussion forum or listserve, let your Diversity Inclusion and Learning Development colleagues know, and maybe even send it to your CEO (there's a message for him/her). Not only will it help women create careers that soar and organizations close the leadership gender gap, it will help TEDxBeaconStreet reach its goal of 10 million view for its 2013 Talks. Lead ON!

What corporate women need to know about strategic relationships ]] One of 2013's top stories for women in leadership was to see Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors become the first woman CEO of any auto company! Mary's route to the top is similar in many ways to other Fortune 500 women. Like most F500 women CEOs, Mary: Is married. Is a mother (two teenagers). Has a Bachelor's degree (electrical engineering) and a Masters (MBA). Has held both line and staff jobs - including a stint as Chief HR Officer, running an assembly plant and as EVP of global product development She's known for her interpersonal skills and team focus, cut-to-the-chase style and focus on the customer "GM executives and outside analysts say Barra's approach is diametrically different, one that relies on team-building and seeks consensus. She holds "hall meetings" to solicit advice on project direction. She challenges engineers and designers to rethink their assumptions. Lutz's motto was "Often wrong, never in doubt." Barra's might be: "Let's all figure this out together." "Mary is trying to bring order to the business," says John Calabrese, GM's vice president of global vehicle engineering, who has worked with Barra in different capacities for 12 years. "She's very methodical, very logical, very fair. She challenges the status quo pretty well. She's provocative. . . . She's an outstanding listener. And I guess she kind of has a consensus approach, but when it's not coming together, she gets concise and she's pretty decisive.'" http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=43985 Unlike many of them, she has not run an international business - although she has been on the supervisory board working to turn around Opel in Europe. You can see her speaking from her role as EVP of global product development. And here is an interview with her as new CEO. And lest we think Mary's appointment is indicative of further rapid progress for women, Catalyst has just released these disappointing statistics in its 2013 Census: Women hold 14.6 percent of Executive Officer positions, essentially the same as last year (14.3%). There was no gain year over year as women held only 8.1% of Executive Officer top earner slots. In both 2012 and 2013, one-fifth of companies had 25 percent or more women Executive Officers, yet more than one-quarter had no women Executive Officers. Clues to this problem addressed here .

What corporate women need to know about strategic relationships ]] "Acquaintances...represent a source of social power, and the more acquaintances you have, the more powerful you are." Malcolm Gladwell in The Tipping Point "Leaders who are good networkers...are the connectors...They master what sociologist Mark Granovetter calls the 'weak tie', a friendly yet casual social connection." Robin Gerber in Leadership the Eleanor Roosevelt Way If you read the above two quotes carefully, you will find a clue to one of the reasons that women are considered by male bosses as under-performing men in the area of having strategic networks and using them effectively. The male model for networking is acquaintances and "weak ties". The female model is...well, actually for many women in leadership it's not at all natural to think about networks , we think about friendships . As a matter of fact, Gail Evans touches on this difference in her book, She Wins, You Win . She writes, "Forget networking. What we really need to be doing is what I call webbing...having a great evening with a friend whom you don't see again until the next time your paths cross is just as viable a relationship...such relationships must become the very fabric of our nexistence..." In other words, she's telling us that it's okay to have acquaintances and "weak ties" with other women for the purpose of business success, but we'll be more comfortable if we call it webbing , not networking ! Your 6 Tips Whether you call it webbing or networking, many women in leadership positions have to reframe our inner game . If you're one, reframing your inner game is one of six tools that can help you make your net work. Here are all 6: Have a Goal : You can have all the acquaintances or friends in the world and take joy in these relationships, but you can't use them strategically if you don't have a goal. What do you want to win in life? What goal(s) do you hold clearly in your mind and close to your heart? When you can answer these questions, you're ready to think about strategic networking. Reframe Your Inner Game : Reframing your inner game means changing any negative thoughts you have about strategic networking. If you think networking is bad, you won't be good at it. If you think it's about interactions in which there's the opportunity to give and to get , you'll have a chance of being good at it. Mastering the Give - Think and then Link : When talking with someone who mentions a problem she's dealing with, an issue he's having, a goal or dream she desires; teach yourself to think, "Who do I know that can help with this?". Then, create the connection - right there, right then if possible. Mastering the Give - Explicit Reciprocity : When you've gone out of your way to help someone in your network and you get thanked, don't say, "It was nothing" or any version of this. Instead, say something like, " I'm sure you'd do the same for me sometime ." Set up the future opportunity for the other person to show gratitude to you by reciprocating in some way at some point in the future. Mastering the Get - The Courageous Ask : The Courageous Ask is a straightforward request made from a position of strength and competence, not from a position of weakness and neediness. It's overt, direct and made without apology. It is easiest to say "yes" to a courageous ask if there is (or has been) a win for the other person. The win may be in the near term, in the past or possible in the future. Mastering the Get - Nurture Your Network : Develop a system that works for you for keeping track of and keeping in touch with the people in your strategic network. If you're not a natural at strategic networking, these 6 tools and techniques will help you make your net work for you. Lead ON!
