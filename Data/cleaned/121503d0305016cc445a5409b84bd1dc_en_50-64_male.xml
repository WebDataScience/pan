 Havana street scene ]] Royce Lamberth The espionage case against Marta Rita Velazquez will be reassigned to a new judge, according to a court document filed today. The case had been assigned to Royce Lamberth, who stepped down in July as chief judge of the District Court in Washington, D.C. Mandatory retirement laws forced Lambert to quit in July after he turned 70. See Washington Post story about his tenure. The court sent the Velazquez case to its calendar committee, where I presume it will be reassigned to another judge. See details of the Velazquez indictment here . ]] William Potts Former hijacker William Potts spent 13 years in a Cuban prison for hijacking a plane to the island in 1984. He said he was stunned to learn he might have to spend two more decades in prison for the crime. I almost fainted, Potts told Along the Malecon in his first media interview since turning himself in to U.S. authorities on Nov. 6. It really rocked me. Potts, 56, is being held in isolation at the Federal Detention Center in Miami. He readily admits he hijacked a Piedmont Airlines flight from New Yorks LaGuardia Airport to Miami International Airport. He had passed a note to a crew member, threatening to shoot passengers and blow up the plane. He also demanded $5 million. William Potts at his ex-wife's apartment in Alamar, Cuba Potts, a former Black Panther, had expected Cuban authorities to welcome him as a fellow revolutionary. Instead, they arrested him and slapped him with a 15-year sentence. That was Potts first big mistake. Now he worries he has made another miscalculation. Before leaving Cuba, he was confident American authorities would give him credit for the more than 13 years he spent in jail in Cuba, leaving him with just a few years behind bars in the U.S. or maybe no prison time at all. William Potts His optimism has since faded. I feel like a steer in a stockyard and the end doesnt look good, he said by phone from the detention center. Please help me. Im facing 20 years to life. Potts was counting on getting the same treatment as Robert Patrick Richter, who had hijacked an Air Florida flight from Tampa to Cuba in 1983. Cuban authorities sentenced him to 20 years in prison, but Richter served just four years before returning to the U.S., surrendering to American authorities and receiving a 5-year jail term. How can they give him five years and he didnt even complete his sentence, and they give me 20 years to life? Potts asked. Potts has not been tried or sentenced in the U.S. yet, but worries he'll be victim of a gross double standard of justice. I did the time for the crime that I committed. Robert Richter, nicknamed Casey, spent only four years in jail. He was white. He got every consideration. He got bail. I was thrown in the isolation cell from the beginning. This is the first chance I have had to use a telephone. I havent even seen the lawyer yet. They havent come to see me. I have no confidence in the public defender. Its a bad situation. I have to beg to get a pencil to prepare my case. Robert "Casey" Richter Things seem to have turned out even worse for Richter, however. He was released on June 16, 1992, and eventually settled in Fort Myers, Fla. But he went missing on June 1, 2003, and his relatives fear hes been murdered. A missing persons bulletin said Richter would now be 57 years old, was six feet tall and had brown eyes and brown hair with "a patch of bright white hair in the middle of the back of his head." Richter also had a scar on the back of his head, where he received 17 stitches after a car accident. Potts said Richter was his cellmate in Cuba. He said Richter managed to leave Cuba thanks to the efforts of his father, John Richter, then a businessman in the Chicago area. Robert Richter. Photo: National Missing Unidentified Persons System John Richter sent a private plane to Cuba, picked up his son and brought him back to the U.S. to face justice. Potts path back to America has been slower. He has two daughters, Ntann, 7, and Assata Shakur, 11, named after an American fugitive in Cuba. The children are living with Potts relatives in the U.S. Im fighting for my children and Im fighting to be reunited with my family, he said. Its kind of crazy. Potts ex-wife, Aime Quesada, is in Cuba but also hopes to join her children in the United States. She said she has applied for a U.S. visa, but consular officers in Havana are backed up and cant see her until September 2015. Quesada said shes desperate to go sooner to see her children. I hope the Interests Section gives me a visa to go get my children and dedicate myself to them for the rest of my life, she said. William Potts Potts trial is set for Dec. 30 in Miami Fort Lauderdale before U.S. District Court Judge Robin S. Rosenbaum. A calendar call in the case is set for 1 p.m. Dec. 18. Potts urges his supporters to write President Obama to appeal for leniency and he hopes someone will start an online petition or a Facebook campaign on his behalf. Ive got to fight this thing. I feel confident I can win." ]] Daryl Hannah in "Blade Runner" Robert "Casey" Richter "wanted to live in a socialist paradise," so he climbed aboard a Boeing 737 in Tampa on July 7, 1983, and said he'd blow up the plane if the pilot didn't fly to Cuba. Richter, then a 26-year-old unemployed computer programer, carried a phony bomb - an Old Spice bottle equipped with a fake fuse - and a note that read, "Viva la Revolucion." "His timing was not good," said his brother, Kelly Richter. "The day before the hijacking, Fidel Castro had said, 'The next guy who hijacks a plane will get 50 years.'" Donald Hannah Cuban authorities arrested Casey Richter and slapped him with a 20-year sentence. But he was freed after just four years, then returned to the U.S., where he served less than five years' jail time. Kelly Richter, 60, said he doesn't know for sure how his brother managed to get out of the Cuban prison before his sentence was completed. He said his father, John Richter, traveled to Cuba five or six times seeking his son's release. On one trip, he met Donald Christian Hannah, an American businessman. Hannah, the father of actress Daryl Hannah, was acquainted with then-President Fidel Castro. John Richter asked Hannah to appeal to Castro for his son's release. As the story goes, Castro was a fan of Daryl Hannah and said he'd consider letting Richter go free if the actress showed up at an international film festival the following year. A police officer arrests Daryl Hannah, an actress and environmental activist About four months later, Cuban authorities told John Richter to send a plane to the island to pick up his son - and that's what he did. Kelly Richter said he doesn't know if Don Hannah's efforts led to Casey Richter's release or if other factors were involved. Robert "Casey" Richter Whatever the case, the FBI arrested the former hijacker when he arrived in the U.S. He was allowed to plead guilty to interference with a flight attendant - a lesser charge than air piracy. A judge gave him five years in jail in January 1989 and he was a free man by June 1992. At the time of the hijacking, witnesses and friends described Casey Richter as "preppy-looking" and "a typical all-American guy." He came from an affluent family in the North Shore, the wealthy suburbs north of Chicago. "He was an idealistic kind of guy," Kelly Richter said. "He may have been mentally unbalanced, but he wasn't a threat." No matter, Cuban authorities may have suspected he was a spy. So he was sent straight to Villa Marista, a notorious prison that often houses political prisoners. He was interrogated over a period of six months, then sent to Cuba's largest prison, Combinado del Este. William Potts, a former Black Panther who hijacked a plane to Cuba in 1984, was Richter's cellmate for "two or three years." He described Richter as "a white guy with progressive ideas. He was a normal, normal American guy. Normal. There was nothing extraordinary about him." Like Richter, Potts, 56, surrendered to American authorities after serving time in Cuba. He believes Richter served less time because "he had lawyers and money." "I don't begrudge him. We got along fine." William Potts Potts is being held without bond at the Federal Detention Center in Miami. His trial is set for Dec. 30. He worries he'll be sentenced to 20 years to life. "It's a bad situation," Potts said. "I don't know what to do. I don't have connections and money. But I want to get out, too." After Richter was set free in the U.S., "he never wanted to talk about his experiences in a Cuban prison," Kelly Richter said. He disappeared for six months before winding up in LaBelle, Fla., near where his mother was living. "He was pretty much a loner," his brother said. Casey Richter had a drinking problem and trouble keeping a job. His family sent him money to help him get by, but the letters and checks started coming back in 2003. His father traveled to Florida to find out what had happened, but could not find any traces of his son. The landlord had thrown out his belongings. "The trail went cold," Kelly Richter said. John Richter died in 2007 without knowing his son's fate. "It bugged my father," Kelly Richter said. "He was always wondering, 'What happened to my son?'" Casey Richter's disappearance "devastated my mother," he said. "She's now 87 years old. It would be nice have some closure for her." Kelly Richter said it's been difficult for him, too. "We grew up together. He was my younger brother. We slept in the same bed until I was 7 or 8 years old." "I don't know what to do at this point. Logic says he's dead. But he had learned to speak Spanish really well in Cuba. Maybe he went down to Venezuela. "I really have no idea where he is." ]] William Potts William Potts spent more than 13 years in prison in Cuba after hijacking a plane from Miami to the island in 1984. He returned to Florida earlier this month, turned himself in and hopes for mercy. Federal sentencing guidelines in the United States call for a minimum mandatory of 20 years for air piracy. If prosecutors give Potts credit for 13 years, he could get a 7-year term. Other factors - his cooperation with authorities, for example - could also influence the outcome of his case. Potts, 56, is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami. His trial is set to begin on Dec. 16. That date could change if his lawyer or prosecutors aren't ready. If the case goes to trial, prosecutors expect the trial would last three days. Both sides still need to examine dozens of documents in the case. Prosecutors, for instance, are waiting to receive State Department documents detailing meetings that Potts had with officials at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana before leaving Cuba on Nov. 6. Potts' lawyer is Robert Berube, an assistant federal public defender in Fort Lauderdale. The prosecutor in the case is Maria K. Medetis, an assistant U.S. attorney in Miami. Wilfredo A. Ferrer The U.S. attorney is Wilfredo A. Ferrer, a Miami native whose parents were born in Cuba. Ferrer told the Daily Business Review: My mom was a legal secretary. My dad was a CPA in Cuba, but he didn't speak any English. My dad would wear signs saying he would cut grass for $5. U.S. District Court Judge Robin S. Rosenbaum is the trial judge. She is currently the Obama administration's nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Rosenbaum presided over a Nov. 19 hearing to decide if Potts could be released pending trial. She wrote: Having considered the evidence presented at the pre-trial detention hearing, the pre-trial services report, and the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(g), this Court finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community and the appearance of the defendant as required if the defendant is released on bond. Therefore, this Court orders the detention of the defendant prior to trial and until the conclusion of trial. In accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(i)(1), this Court makes the following findings of fact and statement of reasons for the detention: The defendant is charged by indictment with aircraft piracy by seizing, by force or violence or threat of force or violence, in violation of Title 49, United States Code, Section 1472(i) (1984). At the pre-trial detention hearing, the United States proffered evidence that on or about March 27, 1984, the defendant boarded a Piedmont Airlines flight from LaGuardia Airport in New York, New York to Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida. As the aircraft was making its approach to Miami International Airport, the defendant passed a note to a flight attendant stating that the defendant was a member of the Black Liberation Army and demanding that the aircraft be diverted to Jose Marti Airport in Havana, Cuba. The note also stated that if the plane landed in Miami, passengers would be shot and the plane would be blown up. The note also demanded five (5) million dollars. The pilot complied with the defendants demands and landed the aircraft in Havana. Thereafter, three passengers separately identified the defendant as the individual who forced the aircraft to be diverted to Havana. Once the flight landed in Havana, the defendant was taken into custody by Cuban law enforcement. The defendant remained in Cuba until his return to the United States on November 6, 2013. The Court notes that the defendant was indicted by a federal grand jury for aircraft piracy, in violation of Title 49, United States Code, Section 1472(i) (1984). The Court finds that pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3142(e)(3)(C), there is a rebuttable presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant in Court as required, and the safety of the community. The Court further finds that the defendant faces a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of twenty (20) years imprisonment if convicted of the charged offense, that the defendant has remained outside the United States for approximately twenty nine (29) years, and that the defendant has a pending state charge for armed robbery out of Bergen County, New Jersey. The significant period of incarceration, the nature of the offense, the weight of the evidence against the defendant, the defendants criminal history, and the facts and circumstances of this case, counsel in favor of detention. Indeed, on this record, the Court finds that the defendant has not rebutted the presumption under Section 3142(c)(3). Based on the above findings of fact, which are supported by clear and convincing evidence, this Court concludes that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community. The Court further finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of this defendant as required. The Court hereby directs that: a. The defendant be detained without bond; b. The defendant be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practical, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal; c. The defendant be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with his counsel; and d. On order of a court of the United States or on request of an attorney for the government, the person in charge of the corrections facility in which the defendant is confined, deliver the defendant to a United States Marshal for the purpose of appearance in connection with court proceedings. ]] USAID chief Rajiv Shah. Credit: London Evening Post The U.S. Agency for International Development released new financial data earlier this summer as part of a campaign to increase transparency.

For the first time ever, you can visit the Foreign Assistance Dashboard and check out how our partners have spent our dollars.* Todays unprecedented release of new financial data includes over 30 database fields and nearly 53,000 recordsall from the first three quarters of fiscal year 2013. Never before has our Agency published spending data so comprehensively and so soon after the close of the quarter. This release is just the latest in a series of important changes we have made to advance President Obamas unparalleled commitment to transparency and our own USAID Forward reform agenda. Below is 2013 spending data related to USAID's programs in Cuba. See the Foreign Assistance Dashboard for more information. * Shah made the announcement on July 30, so this is old news, but I think it's worth sharing. There's more to write about all this, but I haven't had time to dig into it. I haven't been updating Along the Malecon or the Cuba Money Project much at all this summer. I was traveling in Cuba in June and have been editing videos since then. I'll return to blogging as I have time. ]] Hot chocolate Starting off the new year at Versailles restaurant in Miami.

Photo: Broward Sheriff's Office William Potts, the former hijacker who turned himself in to American authorities in November, was moved this week from a federal prison in Miami to the eight-story Broward County Jail in Fort Lauderdale. His lawyer, Robert N. Berube, along with the prosecutor, filed an unopposed motion on Dec. 10 to delay the trial for 45 days. Court records show the trial had been set for Dec. 30. The Dec. 10 motion contradicts that, noting the date as Dec. 16. Whatever the case, the motion states: In all likelihood this case will be resolved without the necessity of a jury trial, however obtaining the potential discovery material in this case is complicated. As a result of Defendant William Potts lengthly incarceration in Cuba, the United States State Department may be in possession of numerous documents that undersigned counsel may be entitled to review. Obtaining the documents from the United States State Department is a time consuming process, however the process has begun. It is unlikely that a second continuance would be requested. Officials moved Potts to Fort Lauderdale because the U.S. District Court where he would be tried is located there. ]] An omnivore named Bill Clinton was president, the Dallas Cowboys were Super Bowl champs and Fidel Castro was in power. Seventeen years later, Clinton is a vegetarian and the Cowboys missed the playoffs yet again, but someone named Castro is still in charge of that insolent island called Cuba. Some democracy activists complain that the United States isnt doing enough to bring about change in Cuba, but others fault the U.S. strategy. The money that the United States has spent trying to overthrow the Cuban government has been money down the rat hole. The proof of it is that the Cuban government is still in place and all that money's been expended to no good end, said William LeoGrande, a political science professor at American University in Washington, D.C. William LeoGrande I don't think anybody who thinks we need a change in U.S. policy towards Cuba is against democracy in Cuba. I think the criticism of the current policy in Cuba is that it's been trying to bring about democracy in Cuba for 50 years and hasn't worked. LeoGrande contends that U.S. democracy programs in Cuba are inefficient, secretive and poorly designed. Documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, and interviews with current and former aid recipients in Havana and Miami show that the U.S. government: Outsources most democracy-building activities to private contractors, hindering oversight and public accountability. Declares its democracy programs to be transparent while refusing to release key details of contractors activities in Cuba. Spends millions of dollars on program administration, travel, office rent and other expenses outside Cuba while many democracy activists  the ones most likely to wind up in prison - struggle to pay for bare necessities. The U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, cited a January 2013 GAO report as evidence that the Cuba programs are sound. U.S. Government programs, which enjoy broad bipartisan backing, support Cubans striving for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, USAID spokesman Kamyl Bazbaz said. We are proud that the most recent GAO report recognized that the programs are well-managed, transparent, and achieving their objectives. USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. The GAO report examined how democracy funds were administered. It showed, for instance, that USAIDs had improved internal financial oversight measures aimed at detecting questionable costs. And those measures, USAID said, led to the identification of $6.8 million in questioned costs. The GAO report did not examine whether the Cuba programs had any impact on the island. Congress has appropriated $225 million for Cuban democracy programs since 1996. USAID received about two-thirds of the money and the State Department got the rest. Over the past five years, annual funding for the programs has ranged from $15 million to $20 million. USAID says it operates its Cuba programs in a transparent fashion. An agency spokeswoman stated: All our program information, in great detail, is listed on our website at www.usaid.gov under Where we work on the Cuba page. The great detail she refers to includes: Six sentences describing the Cuba democracy program. A quote from Barack Obama. A list showing USAIDs seven prime contractors and the amount of money they receive. USAID says nothing about private contractors who operate from foreign countries to evade detection. Or internal memos, filed in lawsuit against USAID, that emphasize secrecy. Or the agencys refusal to release the names of subcontractors working in Cuba. The U.S. government steadfastly conceals full details of its Cuba program spending, despite President Barack Obamas 2009 promise to usher in a new era of open government. In response to dozens of Freedom of Information Act requests filed since December 2010, USAID has released only general information about its Cuba programs, redacting many documents and refusing to disclose others. The government has so far refused to release a single page of information in response to 2011 FOIA requests about the Cuba programs of several of the largest contractors, including Creative Associates International, the Pan American Development Foundation and Development Alternatives Inc., or DAI. Jeremy Bigwood They are very good at stonewalling. USAID is very tricky to work with, said Jeremy Bigwood, a researcher and investigative journalist in Washington, D.C. While they have hundreds of transparency programs for other countries, they're very opaque themselves. Bigwood calls it hypocrisy on steroids. He said: If you're going to go around the world and you're going to put on a show of this stuff about transparency, you have to be transparent yourself. Otherwise, just say - we're not going to be transparent. Just say that - you know, throw out the FOIA. ...if you're going to claim to be a democracy, you've got to act like it. Bigwood sued USAID in 2006 because it refused to name organizations it funded in Venezuela. The agency had poured money into the country to support political groups opposed to Hugo Chavez after a failed coup in 2002. By withholding information on the entities, organizations and corporations that it funds, USAID is transformed from a civilian to a clandestine service, Bigwood argued in one court document. In 2007, a federal judge ruled in favor of USAID, saying that the need to protect aid recipients outweighed Bigwoods interest in knowing how his government was spending tax dollars. Since then, its become even more difficult to obtain documents about the governments inner workings, Bigwood said. That is perhaps one of the most depressing things, he said. It's actually gotten worse. In response to a FOIA request filed in 2010, USAID withheld in its entirety the winning proposal that a contractor submitted in response to the agencys Cuba Democracy and Contingency Planning Program. The agency wouldnt name the contractor and has not responded to an August 2011 appeal of its ruling. But previously hidden details about the program surfaced unexpectedly after Cuban authorities arrested American development worker Alan Gross in 2009. USAID was forced to reveal that the contractor was Development Alternatives Inc., or DAI. The Maryland company had hired Gross to set up satellite Internet connections in Cuba. Gross, 64, and his wife Judy sued DAI and the federal government in November 2012, saying they failed to prepare him for the risky mission. The legal fight has provided a rare glimpse into USAIDs programs. A confidential DAI memo filed in court said top agency officials stressed the importance of secrecy during a private 2008 meeting with DAI. DAI learned during the meeting that the U.S. government had five to seven different transition plans for Cuba. DAI would not be asked to write a new one. Cuban President Raul Castro At the time, the Bush administration was eager to prevent a succession of power from ailing Fidel Castro to his younger brother, Raul. Then-President George Bush had ramped up funding for democracy programs and DAI had been awarded a key $28 million contract. DAIs projects included a daring plan to set up satellite Internet connections under the nose of Cuban state security agents. Said LeoGrande: The democracy programs that USAID runs are essentially covert political action programs. They're the kinds of things that the Central Intelligence Agency used to do before the Reagan administration. So the programs that are targeting Cuba are really unique in that regard, and they really haven't been effective. Peter Kornbluh, a Cuba specialist at the National Security Archive at Georgetown University, agreed. It's been one of the great boondoggles  over $200 million spent on these programs... in which very little has been accomplished on the ground. Sarah Stephens, director of the Center for Democracy in the Americas, questioned whether U.S. government-financed dissidents were in a position to bring about change in Cuba. Cubans dont know who they are, they dont know their names, and so it strikes me as just silliness to be putting a lot of resources into supporting a small group of people who arent really in the position... to make real change. And I say that with a lot of respect for those people and the risks theyre taking and the hardships that they go through. Much of the democracy money destined for Cuba never even reaches the island, Stephens added. The money gets sent through these private contractors and through various NGOs, many of them based in Miami, and large amounts of that money stays in Miami or stays in Florida, and I think that if the taxpayers understood that theyd find this a little more troublesome. There is so little transparency...so little public information about what theyre actually doing with this $20 million. This is not covert, this is not the CIA... and yet you cannot get information about it, and I find that deeply troubling. To hide the trail leading back to Washington, some USAID partners routinely outsource work to subcontractors in such countries as Argentina, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, France and Spain. George Guess In fact, most of the Cuba democracy effort is outsourced, according to George M. Guess, a former DAI official who gave a statement in the Gross lawsuit. USAID "has essentially become a government contracting agency," Guess said. USAID has little or no in-house capacity to design and implement the many different broad policy programs and objectives it is required to carry out. Outsourcing adds to the cost of the democracy programs. It can also undermine accountability, said U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. It's all kind of in the shadows when you start contracting out to these people, she said. U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky To the extent that we actually do some humanitarian efforts and we help with various projects, I don't really have a problem with that. To the extent that we're engaged in regime change, I think it's inappropriate, said the lawmaker, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Darsi Ferret, a former political prisoner in Cuba, said U.S. support is very significant to the democratic cause. Dissidents in Havana are allowed to use the Internet at the American diplomatic post, known as the U.S. Interests Section. And Radio and TV Marti cover dissidents plight and get out their message, Ferret said. Darsi Ferret But most dissidents on the island experience tremendous misery, Ferret said, and see very little money from U.S. democracy programs. The $15 million  I dont know where the $15, or $30 or $50 million winds up. Other dissidents agreed. The day we can give $10 or $15 million to those who are fighting inside Cuba, who often have torn up shoes and pants  there are times when they dont have food for their children  if we could give them $15 million, I assure you that things would be different, said Luis Enrique Ferrer, a former political prisoner who is now the U.S. representative of an opposition group called the Union Patriotica de Cuba, or Patriotic Union of Cuba. If anything, the U.S. government should increase support, Ferrer and other democracy activists said. Alberto de la Cruz The best thing they can do it is continue to support - and provide even stronger support for - the dissidents on the island...for the exiles that are working hard for freedom on the island, and not to give any concessions whatsoever to the Castro regime, said Alberto de la Cruz, editor of Babalu, a popular blog in Miami. Asked how much money reached dissidents and other targets in Cuba, USAID replied in 2010: The vast majority of this money is intended for individuals on the ground in Cuba. Our objective is to maximize the amount of support that benefits Cubans on the island. That said, USAID doesnt reveal precisely how much support reaches Cuba. Tax records of the agencys seven main contractors show that much of their resources go toward salaries, office expenses, conferences and travel  all outside Cuba. Many dissidents wind up receiving only token amounts - $50 or $75 per month. Eugenio Yanez Really, as far as I know, what they receive is what Clint Eastwood would call a fistful of dollars, said Eugenio Yanez, editor of a Miami website called Cubanalisis. Then Cuban authorities accuse them of being mercenaries as if they had robbed Fort Knox. There is no government as effective as Cubas in discrediting the opposition. It handles all these things very skillfully... with no ethical limits. This is a very complex problem, Yanez said. U.S. democracy programs have their flaws, yet bringing democratic change to Cuba without foreign money, without outside support, would be practically impossible. Cuban dissidents often have little or no money of their own because they are expelled from their government jobs as soon as they join the political opposition, Yanez said. Sally Shelton Colby Sally Shelton Colby, a professor at American University, wishes the Obama administration would try another approach. U.S. policy has been a total failure, she said. We've had the same policy for a half a century and it hasn't worked. So there are growing numbers of Americans like myself who feel that it is in the national interest of the U.S. to change that policy. Shelton-Colby, who has been the U.S. ambassador to Grenada, Barbados and other countries, is the former assistant administrator for global programs at USAID. I'm very supportive of democracy promotion where it is possible, she said, but in Cuba this has been a total waste of money. It's time to completely redefine that relationship with Cuba altogether and just end the embargo and establish a normalized relationship. ]] After his release, he returned to the United States, eventually becoming a leader of the Cuban American National Foundation, a Miami exile organization once accused of planning and financing attacks within Cuba. As the years passed, Zamora had a change of heart. He decided that violence was wrong and telling Cubans how to run their country wasnt the answer. You cannot do that. Thats never going to succeed. Antonio Zamora Zamora supports efforts to bring democracy to Cuba, but isnt convinced that all the money the U.S. government has spent on regime-change programs and Radio and TV Marti over the past 30 years has been effective. I mean, its almost a billion dollars, said Zamora, a lawyer. Its ridiculous. Its not a lot of money in the United States, but thats not the point. The point is, what have we done? Some others agree, saying its not the money  or the idea of promoting freedom - that bothers them the most. Its the strategy. Sarah Stephens We have an idea about how Cuba should be, what kind of government it should have, how it should run its country and our policy is all about trying to impose that idea on Cuba, said Sarah Stephens, director of the non-profit Center for Democracy in the Americas in Washington, D.C. It will never work. Josefina Vidal, a senior official at Cubas Foreign Ministry in Havana, said U.S. regime-change programs have had minimal impact in Cuba and have no future on the island. Relations between the two countries in many other areas will continue, she said. But while these programs are maintained, the conditions persist for incidents and frictions to arise, rarifying the bilateral climate and hindering the possibilities of developing a respectful relationship between the two countries. If the U.S. is really interested in establishing a respectful relationship with Cuba, it must end these programs. USAID operates Cuban democracy programs under Section 109 of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act. The act imposes international sanctions against the Cuban government and seeks a transitional government that would lead to a democratically elected government in Cuba. It bars the president from ending U.S. sanctions unless he decides that Cuba has met a series of requirements. These include: Agreeing to free and fair elections within 18 months after a transitional government takes power. Forming a government that does not include Fidel or Raul Castro. Legalizing all political activity. Dissolving its state security forces. Releasing all political prisoners and opening prisons to human rights investigators. Allowing multiple independent political parties equal access to the media. Ending jamming of Radio and TV Marti broadcasts. Taking steps to return property seized from U.S. citizens after the 1959 revolution. Phil Peters Congress reserves the right to reject the presidents findings and keep sanctions in place. Cuba expert Phil Peters regards the Helms-Burton law as counterproductive. Paradoxically... in the very definition of what a democratic government should be, it says it has to be a government that does not include Fidel or Raul Castro. So in the very act of defining democracy, we say that there's certain candidates excluded from any part or participation in government, Peters said. The net result of that is that it makes anything the United States says, from the Cuban government's point of view, a threat to security because in fact we are trying to change the form of government and, of course, that leads them to tune out everything else that we might say, legitimate as it is, about human rights practices. That approach accomplishes nothing, said Peters, president of the Cuba Research Center in Arlington, Va. There are grievous human rights violations in Saudi Arabia...in China and Vietnam, but it's never occurred to the United States to treat those countries the way we treat Cuba. We would be in a much stronger position if we had a more normal relationship. It's not a simple proposition to get there because we're so dug in after 50 years, Peters said. Peter Kornbluh U.S. policy is a Cold War dinosaur, said Peter Kornbluh, a Cuba specialist at the National Security Archive at Georgetown University. The Cuba issue's one of the clearest examples of the colossus of the north trying to exercise its will over a small island nation, he said. The Cold War is long over. Cubas not involved in promoting revolution in other parts of the world. Substantive changes are taking place in Cuban society...and the United States still refuses to change a policy that has been in place for well over 50 years. It's one of the great dinosaurs of the Cold War era, and it's so counterproductive. A 2011 book, "That Infernal Little Cuban Republic, recalls an exchange between then-President Lyndon Johnson and J. William Fulbright, then-chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Johnson said: Im not getting into any Bay of Pigs deal. No, Im just asking you what we ought to do to pinch their nuts more than were doing. Fulbright recommended economic sanctions. Nut-pinching has been U.S. policy ever since, wrote Lars Schoultz, author of the book. In the 1980s, former Army Gen. Alexander Haig offered to use force to oust Fidel Castro. He told then-President Reagan: You just give me the word and Ill turn that f------ island into a parking lot. Instead, Reagan authorized the creation of Radio Marti and refused to deal with the Cuban government, telling a reporter, If theyd ever like to rejoin the civilized world, wed be happy to help them. But not under the present circumstances. In 2003, then-President George W. Bush created the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. He said he was preparing for "the happy day when Castro's regime is no more..." Roger Noriega, then-assistant secretary of state, summed up the administration's view: The United States.....will not accept a succession scenario. Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell was first chair of the commission. He issued the group's first report in May 2004. The 456-page tome showed U.S. officials were planning Cuba's future down to the last detail. For instance, the report said, if Cuba's transitional government requested help, the U.S. government was prepared to: Provide dam safety training, in Spanish Help upgrade airport lighting and signs Simplify the sale of refurbished U.S. locomotives to Cuba Help map coral reef systems and assess fish habitat Train park managers Give advice on how to add trails and other infrastructure to prime bird watching spots Treat and control solid waste But until Cuba surrendered, U.S. officials refused to deal with the socialist government or talk to Fidel Castro. Bush explained: Whats the point of talking to him? All Id tell him is what Im telling you, to give the people the freedom that they want. And then youll see the United States do exactly what we should: Go down and lift those people up. Bushs sentiment seemed to be that the U.S. had an obligation to civilize Cuba, Schoultz said in an interview. Cuban-Americans didnt identify with the civilizing mission, but supported the democracy programs. These Cuban Americans have not a bit of interest in a civilizing mission, said Schoultz, a professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. They are using democracy promotion programs as a vehicle to strengthen the government's critics. Their goal is to overthrow the Cuban government. Cuban officials managed to stay in power even after Fidel Castro fell ill in 2006 and dropped out of sight. Hoping to seize the moment, Bush pushed Cuban democracy spending to a high of $44 million in 2008. Among those receiving money was USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives or OTI, which specializes in rushing to hotspots and fragile nations around the world to promote democracy, peace and reconciliation. Public records dont make clear how it spent all its Cuba money. At least some of it went to a Washington, D.C., contractor called Creative Associates International for a program called, Outreach to New Sectors of Cuba Society. The project was designed to expand the network of independent actors working together toward positive, democratic change on the island. USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. USAID has not answered a 2011 FOIA request for documents related to Creatives programs in Cuba. Records show USAID in 2008 agreed to give Creative $6.5 million, the first installment of what was to be a three-year $15,535,979 contract to carry out the sensitive OTI operation. The mission involved establishing a secret base in Costa Rica that would support democracy activists in Cuba. OTI had rushed to launch its Cuba program in 2007 because U.S. officials thought the country was on the verge of change. A program document stated: With President Fidel Castros resignation after 49 years in power and the recent selection of Raul Castro as his successor, Cuba is, at the very least, undergoing a symbolic transition that might signal a broader democratic political transition in the near future... Contract documents show that Creative eventually received around $11 million, falling $4,365,308 short of the $15.5 million contract amount. Records also show that the company shut down its Costa Rica office, but neither Creative nor USAID has ever explained why or acknowledged the existence of the operation. Despite the blatant lack of transparency and accountability, most lawmakers have been reluctant to tinker with the democracy programs for fear of losing votes in Florida, Schoultz said. Once they created this democracy weapon in the early to mid-1990s, it became almost impossible to pry it out of their hands - Florida's 29 electoral votes are too important, he said. In recent years, however, the Cuban-American vote has lost some of its importance in the presidential race. Obamas victory was declared in 2012 before the votes in Florida were even fully counted, Kornbluh said. You have a complete change in the Cuban-American community in Florida with the historicos of the Miami community... coming to a generational end of their influence. William LeoGrande Today a majority of the Cuban-Americans actually are in favor of greater engagement with the island, said William LeoGrande, a political science professor at American University. They travel to Cuba to see family. They send remittances to help out their families on the island. They don't want to see the continuation of this policy of unmitigated hostility. John McAuliff, director of the Fund for Reconciliation and Development, is convinced that better relations with Cuba are possible. I think we're at one of those tipping points. The president and the secretary of state have to decide whether they want to be the historic figures who bring about a normal relationship between the two countries. It's clear that the Cubans are ready to have that happen. They're ready to have negotiations without any preconditions. They're ready to have the kind of relationship that the United States has with Vietnam, with China. For now, though, the low-intensity U.S.-Cuba conflict rages on and theres no end in sight. Some $30 million or so is expected to be set aside for Cuban democracy programs over the next two years. The federal government spends even more money on Radio and TV Marti  some $700 million since 1983. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting operates Radio and TV Marti from its headquarters in Miami. It has intensified its efforts to promote Internet freedom and reach Cubans on mobile phones and social networking sites over the past two years. One project is a $2 million effort that involves sending millions of text messages to cell phone users in Cuba and blocking Cuban efforts to jam Radio and TV Marti. Many other U.S. government projects are in the works. None of them involve talking to the Cuban government to try to settle the more than half-century-long grudge match. President Obama was right when he was campaigning in 2007 and said that Cuba policy's been 50 years of failure, we need to try something new, LeoGrande said. The problem is, he hasn't really been able or willing to spend the political capital to really try something new. So policy today is not fundamentally different than it has been since 1959. The goal is regime change. Obama doesn't want to do it by force. He wants to do it by gradual coercion and nudging Cuba to change in the way that the United States would like it to change. But he's no more willing than George Bush was to normalize relations with Cuba until Cuba changes in the way we want it to. Despite the hardline policy, the Cuban government has not collapsed. The Cuban government today is as consolidated and stable as it's ever been, and U.S. policy now is stuck in a situation where we won't talk to them until they change. We have no leverage and no influence over their future, LeoGrande said. He considers Americas Cuba policy to be an abject failure. In 1959, the Eisenhower administration decided that the Cuban regime had to be overthrown and virtually every president since then has stuck with that basic policy. Antonio Zamora Back in Miami, Zamora said he lost many of his friends when he decided U.S. policy was wrong and spoke out against it. But he has no regrets. He said his closest friends  men he fought with during the Bay of Pigs invasion  havent left his side, even if they disagree with some of his views. My real friends remain friends, he said. ]] 254 Steps from Tracey Eaton on Vimeo . ]] Above is an interesting map showing underwater cables surrounding Cuba.

The message: John F. Kennedy had been shot and was dead. "They're going to say we did it," Castro reportedly said. And that is what happened, according to Peter Kornbluh, director of the Cuba Documentation Project at the National Security Archive in Washington, D.C. Kornbluh has dedicated much of his career to digging up once-classified documents and other information to try to get to the bottom of historic events involved the United States and Cuba. He and William LeoGrande are authors of a forthcoming book called, "Talking With Cuba: The Hidden History of Diplomacy between the United States and Cuba."

The Cuban Interests Section would like to inform that consular services will be immediately resumed on a temporary basis up to February 17, 2014. The Cuban Interests Section in Washington continues its efforts to find a new bank to handle its bank accounts and, to the extent that this is achieved, it would be able to provide consular services on a regular basis. The Cuban Interests Section regrets any inconvenience the suspension of consular services last November 26 may have caused Cuban and American citizens and will provide timely information on future developments regarding this matter. ]] Cuban Spy Works from Tracey Eaton on Vimeo . ]] William Potts in Cuba. Photo: Tracey Eaton This is a letter from William Potts, who has been trying to return to the United States from Cuba. Open Letter To The President From American Muslim Hijacker Apparently High officials in the Obama administration have targeted me and have decided to make me into a modern day Black Nathan Hale by refusing to issue me a one way passport that would allow me to return home to the U.S. after having completed a 15 year prison sentence in Cuba for hijacking. On March 27th 1984 I hijacked a North American airliner from New York to Havana Cuba. There I was taken into custody, tried in a Cuban court of law and sentenced to fifteen years in prison, all in accordance with the strict and specific stipulations of The Hague Convention For The Prevention Of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft to which both the U.S. and Cuba are both signatories. Robert Patrick Richter, a white American, who also hijacked a plane to Cuba, in July 1983, was issued such a passport and a twin engine private plane was procured and the white American hijacker did in fact return to the United States in 1988 where he was sentenced to five additional years by U.S. District Judge William Zloch taking into consideration the time Richter had already spent in Cuban prison. Two convicted American hijackers. One white, the other Black. Why the double standard? I have been in contact, since September of 2012, with the Asst. U. S. District Attorneys office of Mr. Todd Mestepey and have made clear my sincere desire to return to the United States and face the charges against me. A Mr. Brent Brown, a U.S. federal officer I met with at the U.S. Interest Section here in Havana to discuss my imminent return to the U.S. informed me that he was awaiting instructions from Mr. Mestepeys office to issue me a document, a one way passport, which would allow me to return directly to the United States. At that meeting Mr. Brown, to my surprise, treated me quite decently. He explained to me how, due to the outstanding federal warrants against me, I would formally be taken into federal custody and how the return would play out. Everything Mr. Brown explained was perfectly reasonable and completely acceptable to me. Over a year has passed however and I have yet to be issued this one way passport to travel back home to begin the judicial process, the only process by which this pending case of nearly thirty years can finally be brought to a close. I have written to the Asst. U.S. District Attorney s office and have made repeated visits to the U.S. Interest Section here in Havana all to no avail. I have even written to President Obama with all due respect and have asked him, in all humility, to prevail upon the Asst. U.S. District Attorneys office to move with all due haste to act swiftly to instruct the competent personnel of the U. S. Interest Section here in Havana, whos function it is to handle cases such as mine, to make available to me the necessary documentation which would allow me to return home, albeit in the custody of Mr. Brown, to begin the process of bringing this case to a just conclusion and yet my earnest plea apparently has fallen on hardened hearts and deaf ears fore the Asst. U.S. District Attorney s office show no signs of interest in bringing this old case to a just conclusion. Quite to the contrary their perpetual stalling antics and stonewalling tactics indicate to me that they have every intention of obstructing justice indefinitely by not issuing me the necessary document to return to my country of origin to face any and all charges that maybe pending against me. This is unique, I believe, in the annals of jurisprudence in that both an accused and convicted terrorist wishing voluntarily to surrender to federal authorities to face charges stemming from an outstanding warrant for his arrest for the crime of skyjacking wasn t taken into custody by the F.B.I. because they don t want to do the necessary paperwork. Or is there perhaps another reason, like they don t have a case due to the fact that, unlike the white American hijacker, I completed my 15 year sentence? Whatever the reason the matter can not remain thus (I won t allow it.) and must be settled definitively once and for all. For the crime I committed I was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and I did every day. I paid my debt. All that remains is a moral imperative I feel to present myself before the passengers and crew of that flight and express to them personally my sincere remorse at having endangered them although I made every possible effort to ensure their safety and comfort the entire duration of the action. The trifling stalling shenanigans of the Asst. U.S. District Attorney s office is reprehensible in the injustice it does to me and my family, and regrettable in that it has failed to take advantage of a unique opportunity to work together with me (of whom they obviously have no case) in order to dissuade and possibly prevent another hijacking in the future by some ideologically misguided youth somewhere, and in the process avert a catastrophe and save innocent lives. A man who commits a crime, especially one in which there was no loss of life, is imprisoned and pays his debt to society is entitled to a second chance to begin his life anew with a clean slate and a fresh start. The U.S. representatives of justice should understand this, one would think, but instead of understanding my every overture of peace has been met with a smug, cynical vindictive attitude and I came to realize in time that the U.S. representatives have assumed an unethical and possibly illegal position against me which they intend to maintain indefinitely. I have, therefore, no other recourse open to me but to fight them for my right to return home and be reunited with my family at last. I initiate this hunger strike now the 21st of October 2013 determined to bring this lamentable episode to an end one way or another. God knows I don t want to end up like Bobby Sands. I have a family and two excellent children and in them I have everything to live for, but if I fail to pick up this gauntlet that the U. S. Asst. District Attorney s office has thrown to the ground at my feet then I must resign myself to a de facto life sentence and abandon any hope of ever being reunited with my family again, and this is something that I will never do. Yes, I did the crime, and I m sorry for it, but I did the time too. Now all I want to do is go home. (Like the other fellow.) The U.S. Asst. District Attorneys office should be called out for these reprehensible racist shenanigans and pressure should be brought to bare upon the U.S. authorities to stop playing these stupid color games and issue me my passport so that I can come home. I wish to return home, to my country of origin, the United States of America, in order to face any and all charges that may still be pending against me in an effort to bring to an end finally this lamentable and regrettable episode and also to initiate, if possible, a reconciliation between myself and those innocent people involved who I, by that unjustifiable act, have wronged. Nearly thirty years have passed since I hijacked that plane to Cuba and yet not a day goes by that I dont regret that action. That misguided act of terrorism terrorizes me every day when I reflect on what if something had gone wrong and that plane had crashed.... There were over a hundred people on that plane. I pray to Allah five times a day for the chance to sincerely apologize to the people directly affected by my act of terrorism and to try in some way to make amends directly to those people. Allah knows that I do not lie when I say this is my only motive coupled with that of being reunited with my family at long last, also victims of my impetuous and misguided act. This case has gone on for entirely too long and its time now to bring it finally to a close and so it is in the true spirit of Islam, that of peace, that I call on President Obama to let me come back home now. I personally make him a solemn promise that I will never give him cause to regret his decision, devoting the rest of my life to farming, as I have learned in Cuba to love, the raising of my own two little girls and speaking out whenever and wherever necessary for peace and understanding between people everywhere in the hope that my testimony may serve to dissuade some other misguided youth from committing a similar act of terrorism. I call upon President Obama to intervene, if not on my behalf then on the behalf of fairness, justice and common decency, lauded hallmarks of the American way, and not allow racist bureaucrats to waste my life away in this manner because like it or lump it, I am an American, the United States of America is my home, and it s time for me now to come home. Sincerely Yours William G. Potts Jr. ]] Exiled Cuban dissidents gathered Sunday in Miami to talk about ways to unite opposition to Cuba's socialist government. The event was called "Primer Encuentro Fraternal de Opositores Cubanos." I am writing a story about the meeting for Cuba News . Participants included Darsi Ferret, Francisco Chaviano, Pedro Pablo Alvarez, a dozen members of Las Damas de Blanco, including Josefa Lopez and Matilde Jerez, and brothers Miguel, Ariel and Guido Sigler. See more photos on jump page. ]] At the same time, the U.S. Agency for International Development was busy fielding questions from contractors interested in the latest Cuba-related opportunity: up to $6 million for companies interested in shuttling Cuban democracy activists to third countries for hands-on human rights and democracy training. One contractor asked: Would USAID require that Cuba participants in the program be notified of the source of funds for the program? USAID didnt have a yes or no answer to that question. The agency replied: Implementing partners would be expected to take the in-country environment into account to minimize risks, keeping in mind that this is a transparent program... Four years after Cuban authorities arrested Alan Gross, pro-democracy work in Cuba remains perilous and the U.S. goal is much the same: To help Cuba's democracy activists push the socialist government from power. Cuban officials are just as resolute and vow to undermine USAID's democracy programs in any way they can. Josefina Vidal The programs...have an interventionist, hostile and destabilizing nature, said Josefina Vidal, a senior official at Cubas Foreign Ministry in Havana. They are founded on the principles of the Helms-Burton Act, which aims to achieve regime change in Cuba, completely dismantle the economic, political and social system, and impose a government, against the will of Cubans, which serves the interests of the United States. These programs are semi-clandestine and semi-undercover by their nature and by the way in which they are implemented, behind the back of Cuban authorities and surrounded by secrecy about their true intentions. As Cuban officials see it, Alan Gross is living proof of the U.S. governments persistent regime-change campaign. Gross was a soldier, albeit of a different sort. Instead of the usual M9 pistol, he carried a Samsonite briefcase, plenty of cash and 15 credit cards. In place of a combat uniform and boots, he wore beige Lands End pants and brown Rockport shoes. He spoke no Spanish, but was an experienced international development worker and had worked in such hotspots as Afghanistan and the Middle East. Alan Gross His weapon was technology. He traveled to Havana in 2009 with satellite communication gear, wireless transmitters, routers, cables and switches  enough to set up Internet connections and Wi-Fi hotspots that the socialist government would not be able to detect or control. He worked for Development Alternatives Inc., a Maryland contractor that USAID had hired to carry out a democracy-promotion program. Such programs were authorized under the Helms-Burton Act. In response, Cuban authorities in 1999 passed Law 88, which prohibited acts aimed at supporting, facilitating or collaborating with the goals of the Helms-Burton law. So it should have been clear to Gross that what he was doing was illegal under Cuban law. And by all appearances, Cuban agents were ready for him. They monitored his activities at first, then arrested him after his fifth trip to the island. The U.S. government had trumpeted its attack strategy in advance, depriving Gross of the element of surprise. As far back as 2006, the State Department had said it was looking for contractors who could provide creative and innovative ways to break the information blockade in Cuba using high-tech communication devices. Disclosing such opportunities is a hallmark of competitive bidding, but it also alerts Cuban authorities, putting someone like Gross at a severe disadvantage. Phil Peters It's kind of naive, very naive really, to think that you can go into Cuba and operate a program like that, Cuba expert Phil Peters said. It was the most predictable catastrophe that one could imagine. I mean, Cuban state security is not a casual 9-to-5 organization. They don't have a lackadaisical attitude about things like this. The idea of the U.S. government setting up a bunch of Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the capital and other places in the country is not something that they're going to take lightly. Peters, a former State Department official, has studied Cuba for more than 20 years and travels to the island frequently. He said trying to set up satellite Internet connections in an authoritarian nation like Cuba makes no sense at all even if you love the purposes of it. I don't think it's really possible to explain logically how it's all supposed to work at the operational level. And then, of course, Mr. Gross was a little bit naive to think that he could do what he was doing as if he was in Hartford, Connecticut, instead of Havana, Cuba. After Cubans threw Gross in jail, he lost: His 2,693-square-foot four-bedroom home worth $838,000 along tree-lined Pebble Brook Lane in Potomac, Md. His company, the Joint Business Development Center, Inc. A lucrative contract with Development Alternatives Inc., of Bethesda, Md. Gross, now 64, gave up something even more valuable: His freedom. A Cuban court sentenced him to 15 years in jail. If he serves the full sentence  and survives prison  he wont be out until 2024 when he is 75. Lawyers for Gross say DAI and USAID refused to accept any responsibility for his troubles after his arrest. In November 2012, Gross and his wife Judy sued the contractor and the government for $60 million. Judy Gross outside Cuban Interests Section. Photo: AP Alan is a pawn from a failed policy between the two governments... two countries that dont have diplomatic relations, Judy Gross told a reporter after her husbands conviction. The trial wasnt about him. It was about USAID and U.S. policy towards Cuba. DAI settled for an undisclosed amount on May 16, 2013. Twelve days later, U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg threw out the familys claim against the government, saying it was immune from prosecution. The family appealed the ruling. DAI chief executive James Boomgard said Gross was simply providing humanitarian aid to Jews in Cuba. It's such an innocuous, innocent thing, he told a reporter after Grosss arrest. I'm not a Cuba expert, but other people who understand the politics of this are puzzled as well. U.S. officials have expressed similar amazement and have dismissed notions of a regime-change strategy: On July 13, 2010, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said Gross was in Cuba to help the Jewish community better communicate with one another and the world through the use of internet technology. On July 13, 2010, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Gross did not commit any crime. He was in Cuba as a humanitarian and development worker and, in fact, was assisting the small Jewish community in Havana that feels very cut off from the world... On Oct. 25, 2011, Ambassador Ronald Godard said Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crime of trying to connect Cuba's Jewish communities to the Internet. On Dec. 2, 2011, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Gross was sentenced for simply facilitating connectivity between Havanas Jewish community and the rest of the world. On Nov. 2, 2012, State Department Victoria Nuland said, Alan Gross is guilty of nothing and he should be released. The tune was much the same after the July 17 U.S.-Cuba talks. The State Department reiterated its call for the Grosss release, saying hed been imprisoned solely for trying to facilitate communications between Cubas citizens and the rest of the world. Court documents filed in the Gross lawsuit revealed there was much more to the story. His memos to DAI showed he envisioned setting up satellite Internet connections for Jews in seven Cuban provinces, then expanding his effort to include as many as 30,000 Masons at more than 300 lodges across the country. Cuban Jews had "strategic value" because of their religious, financial and humanitarian ties to the United States, Gross wrote. Jewish synagogues were a "secure springboard through which information dissemination will be expanded. An infographic Gross submitted to DAI cited additional targets: "Youth, women and Afro-Cubans." DAI had been working toward setting up operations that would have allowed the federal government to establish a USAID base in Cuba, court records show. The agency had promised DAI $28 million for its work, but the plan had to be abandoned after Cuban authorities jailed Gross. Cuban authorities accused Gross of working to design and implement a program to destroy or overthrow the economic, political and social order established by the Cuban people... They said Gross unlawfully imported wireless satellite communication equipment for the purpose of creating clandestine networks that would give Cuban people access to distorted news reports aimed at causing confusion and discontent against the legitimately established political and revolutionary power in Cuba. Gross denied the accusations. He said in a statement: I do deeply regret that my actions have been misinterpreted as harmful and a threat against the security and independence of Cuba. Surely, this runs counter to what I had intended. ....I did nothing in Cuba that is not done on a daily basis in millions of homes and offices around the world. I have an immense fondness for the people of Cuba, and I am deeply sorry . . . my family and I have paid dearly for this. The Cuban court said the subcontractors recognition of his actions did not reflect any spontaneous or effective repentance. The defendant did not acknowledge the politically destructive intent of his actions. Jose Manuel Collera Well, these programs have a goal. The goal is the destruction of the Cuban revolution and they have not had any results, said Jose Manuel Collera, a Cuban state security agent who was a witness in the Gross trial. We need to get Alan Gross home, said Sarah Stephens, director of the Center for Democracy in the Americas. And that really falls obviously to both governments, but the United States needs to understand that he broke the law in Cuba and has to sit down and talk to the Cuban government about some kind of arrangement to get him home. Alan Gross is sitting in a Cuban prison because of our USAID-funded democracy promotion program in Cuba. I think its very important to stop and understand why. I mean, the objective of these programs is essentially to replace the existing government. Its regime change. Peter Kornbluh, a Cuba specialist at the National Security Archive at Georgetown University, said Cuban authorities worried that USAID was setting up secret communications systems on the island as part of a plan to promote an Arab Spring-like uprising. U.S.-Cuba relations have been poisoned by the continuing effort to basically take a program that is supposed to be above board and overt and transform it into a surreptitious semi-covert operation with people who are really not trained and supervised to undertake these kinds of operations, Kornbluh said. You can imagine if you're a Cuban watching this, how concerned, annoyed, insulted, and angry you would be. Harold Cardenas Lema Harold Cardenas Lema, a Cuban blogger and philosophy professor, said he considers it legitimate that the U.S. help a country improve its technology to help improve Internet access. But such efforts shouldnt come with hidden political intentions and hidden agendas, he said. The explicit intention is to change the regime, he said. After Cuban authorities arrested Gross, they seized his high-tech gear, including BGAN satellite terminals, which allows users to connect to the Internet and make phone calls. Authorities kept that equipment, but eventually returned the Americans other belongings, which included: A black Eagle Creek bag, eight shirts, nine pairs of socks, six pairs of underwear, a well-worn blue raincoat, a hair brush, dental floss, a sewing kit, a nail clipper, two Gillette razors, two bags of paper napkins, Listerine, a silver chain made in Israel, a black change purse, five keys, eyeglasses, a Suunto compass, four candles, two guitar picks, a Radio Shack alarm clock, a Canon PowerShot camera and six $100 bills. Gross is being held in a high-security military hospital in Havana. Kornbluh met with him for four hours on Nov. 28. Peter Kornbluh I actually said, You know, Alan, your case is standing in the way of improving U.S.-Cuban relations and he was so crystal clear on this. He said, No, you're wrong about that. The lack of better U.S.-Cuban relations is standing in the way of resolving my case. I think the United States and Cuba should sit down and have a dialogue. They should sign a non-aggression pact right away to kind of improve the basic foundation of their relationship, and then in a second or third series of talks, as they go through their agenda, they should get to the issue of me and my getting out of here. Kornbluh said he has tried to get that message across to the Obama administration. He asked: What is the problem with simply sitting down and having a dialogue with Cuba? The fact that the Obama administration won't even sit down and talk to Cuba about a wide variety of things, not just Alan Gross, tells you how timid the government is. If you're Alan Gross, you can only be extremely discouraged and extremely angry that you don't have the government at your back in a situation like this. Alan Gross certainly feels that he has been abandoned by his own government. Gross now resides with two other inmates in a 10-by-12 foot room. He has health trouble, including chronic arthritis, and has lost more than 100 pounds since 2009. His wife, Judy, a psychiatric social worker, had to move into a Washington, D.C., apartment after his arrest and now works more than 50 hours per week to pay the bills. The case destroyed her husbands career and livelihood and hes been unable to see his mother, who has terminal lung cancer, and his oldest daughter, who has been fighting breast cancer. Scott Gilbert The tragedy faced by the Gross family is horrific. What is mind-boggling is that this never should have come to pass, his lawyer, Scott Gilbert, said in a statement. The destruction of this family is the direct result of a project approved, overseen and administered by DAI and our government that was flawed from conception and pursued with complete disregard for Mr. Gross safety and well-being.
