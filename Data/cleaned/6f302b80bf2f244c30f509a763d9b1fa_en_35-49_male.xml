 (water brush,pen digital stuff) This Winter seems like a lot of people isn't very happy that a new year is starting.In fact,looks like they're mostly happy that 2010 is over.Guess it was a rough year for them.Me,you ask? It was a good,quite productive and inspiring year...actually,I wish it didn't finish so soon as I haven't finished lots of things and projects yet.Then again,I suppose that's what 2011 is here for,since time is always relative.And just for making things more exciting,this happens to be the first year of a whole decade. Now,today is also the LJversary of this corner of the web.It was 7 years ago when I began posting here.It's also been 7 years of discovering and meeting some of the most great people on the internets.That's a good enough reason for celebrating this day,so if you're reading this don't stop and go ahead.You're part of it and by the way,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT! Okay now,Are you ready to show 2011 that dreams do become true? Come along,the fun it's only beggining!

Plus,if you saw Finding Nemo,you know they behave like surfers so that's extra coolness points. 8) My favorite game is the Darkstalkers series,but I already drew myself as a wolf monster.So my second choice is Haomaru from the Samurai Shodown/Samurai Spirits series. 9) Yup,that's me.I'm not tagging anyone in particular so anyone can do the meme if wanting to.]] (brush...but also enough computer stuff to say it's practically an all-digital illo) Here's a brand new picture for the Ilustrando Que Es Gerundio blog.The chosen theme was Classic Arcade Games.

It's the 1st day of the tiger month on Chinese calendar so that means it's year 4708,the year of the White (Metal) Rabbit (or cat,if you're in Vietnam). Chinese folklore describe rabbit as related to yin forces.A gentle,affectionate and shy creature,the rabbit has no conflicts with any other animals except the chicken.As everyone knows,rabbits are good at multiplying and so rabbit years are described as very fertile ones.However,they don't bring huge prosperity at all because rabbits are more on the gentle and silent side of things (in luck matters,basically it means that most everyone should expect to have the same luck they had the previous year).The main characteristic of rabbit years is that they're peaceful and so they're best for relaxing and getting in touch with family,friends and inner nature. Hope that this year of the rabbit brings you some good fortune and prosperity!]] (brush digital stuff Automan  20th Century Fox Film Corporation) I wasn't looking forward to Tron Legacy,since the original movie actually made me asleep when I was younger and cuter.While watching the movie I kept thinking that The Matrix was a better sequel/remake/whatever if you think about worlds inside computers.Then I also remembered that Tron already had another unofficial sequel using costumes with bright lights and more action: Automan .Now,if something needs a remake/sequel/whatever,that TV series is.I mean,that series was okay for its time but no one can deny that it was poor executed in many aspects so there's a good reason to make it all over again and make it right this time hey,isn't that supposed to be the point of remakes after all?

And so El Naco Asesino (with his loyal sidekick Macuarrito) was born.But instead of a psycho knight he became a Mexican vigilante.More exactly,the Mexican parody version of Batman and Daredevil and Azrael and The Punisher and Conan The Barbarian.Carlo Angie wrote some ideas and I drew them.Nothing big,there were only a few pages and gags that made it into Xerox fanzines and that was all.
