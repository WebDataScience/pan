 Theres a double-edged sword thing when it comes to being diagnosed as cyclothymic. On the one hand, I count my damn blessings Im not Bipolar I or II; I cycle too quickly to meet the criteria for either. On the other hand/edge/whatever, Im still left with murmurs of the aforementioned disorders and they still dick [...]]] Ok, people. Lets clear something up. Ready? Im gonna kindergarten it down for you. Hypothesis: When you have an idea which can be tested. Theory: A hypothesis youve tested and your peers have tested and your findings (and theirs) have been replicated by you and your peers. Lots of times. Everything comes out groovy at [...]]] Believe it or not, your pancakes wont stick to your pan if the pan is hot enough. Promise. I made 12 of these bad boys Saturday and not a one stuck. I didnt think it was possible either but I listened to the wise man who is Alton Brown and he didnt let me down. [...]]] Even though I have a whole category dedicated to Food and Drink, I havent posted a recipe for Simple Syrup (Its included in a lot of cocktail recipes so Im a bit chagrined to have overlooked this.). Simple Syrup isnt just for drinks. Its used in all sorts of recipes and comes in handy for sweetening [...]]] One of the perks of reviewing products is when the product Im sent to review is some sort of alcohol. Cause seriously? You cant beat that with a stick. Right? (Thank you, Molly, for being so patient with me. Mollys the awesome lady who sent me this to review and life happened and its taken [...]]] This years garden had three unexpected residents: crooked neck squash. I like squash just fine (sauteed in bacon grease with onions, thankyouverymuch) but Cara and Ollie hadnt ever been exposed to the vegetable. This was a teaching moment and the kids would grow to love the bumpy, funny shaped, yummy, yellow things. Little problem though. [...]]] Even though there hasnt been much new content here, I havent stopped writing. I got back into the habit of writing things out long-hand in my notebooks. This is how I started way back when I first started Taste Like Crazy. Cara was a (rather loud) baby then and I would sit on our porch [...]]] When you're a gifted, worrying, perfectionist seven year old kid, sometimes all that worry can literally make you sick. I figured listing out the things that WERE going to happen (but maybe she was worried they wouldn't) would give Cara, my kid, a few less things (20, actually) to stress over. Seems to be working. Maybe it'll work for you, too. Even if you're not a seven year old girl. ]] I have lots of feels tonight, people so youre basically going to serve as my best-friend/therapist/sounding board/something. Just listen. Err...read. And if youre feeling all TL:DR, you can get to the main point by clicking here. This is a rather long, ranty, gif filled post of awesome but I know some of you cant handle [...]]] One morning, when I was 14, I was quite rudely awakened by a knife in my stomach.  At least thats what it felt like.  I dont know how long I laid on the tiny, black and white tiles in my bathroom with nothing on but my birthday suit and just sweat. Buckets and buckets of [...]]]
